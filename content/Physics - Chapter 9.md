Chapter 9 of the Pearson Physics textbook by James S. Walker

## 9.1

magnitude of gravitational force = G * $\frac{(mass1) * (mass2)}{(distance between masses)^2}$ OR F = G$\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$ 
G is a constant values at 6.67 * 10$^{-11}$ N * $\frac{m^2}{kg^2}$

Newton's law of gravity describes that all objects in the universe attract all other objects in the universe
## 9.3

- To make an object move in a circle with constant speed, a force that is directed toward the center of the circle must act on the object
- centripetal acceleration = $\frac{speed^2}{radius}$ = $\frac{v^2}{r}$  
- centripetal force = mass * centripetal acceleration

## 9.4

### Kepler's First Law
- Kepler discovered that the orbit of Mars was elliptical 

### Kepler's Second Law

### Kepler's Third Law

T = ($\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{GM_E}})$r$^{\frac{3}{2}}$ 

T = the period
r = radius
G = gravitational constant (6.67 * 10$^{-11}$ N * $\frac{m^2}{kg^2}$)
M$_E$ = Mass

v = $\sqrt{\frac{GM_E}{r}}$

T = 2$\pi\sqrt{\frac{r^3}{Gm_E}}$ 

T =
