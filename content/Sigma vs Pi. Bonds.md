Introduced to this in [[AP Chemistry]]

## What is it?

sigma bond ($\sigma$) - bond that results from the overlapping of [[Orbital Hybridization|hybridized orbitals]] (or hydrogens 1s orbitals) on adjacent atoms

pi bond ($\pi$) - bond that results from the side interaction of [[Orbital Hybridization|unhybridized p orbitals]] on adjacent atoms

- single bond: 1 sigma
- double bond: 1 sigma + 1 pi
- triple bond: 1 sigma + 2 pi

*99% of questions for sigma and pi you need to know the concepts listed above*
