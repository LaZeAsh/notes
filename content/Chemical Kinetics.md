## Rate Laws

- Study the reaction directly after the reaction starts - so you only study reactants
- 2 types of rate laws:
	- `Differential` - rate depends on \[concentration]
		- \[] references to the molarity of
	- `Integrated` - concentration depends on time
	- **Use whichever is easier to experimentally determine**

### The Differential Rate Law

If the question asks "Rate Law" then it's referring to Differential Rate Law. Do **NOT** use Integrated

The rate law expresses the relationship of the rate of a reaction to the rate constant and the concentrations of the reactants raised to some powers

Rate law (DIFFERENTIAL REMEMBER!) can **ONLY** be determined experimentally

aA + bB -> cC + dD

Rate = k\[A]$^x$\[B]$^y$ 

k = rate constant
x and y = calculated values

reaction is x$^{th}$ order in A

reaction is y$^{th}$ order in B

reaction is (x+y)$^{th}$ order overall

#### Example

F$_2$ (g) + 2 ClO$_2$ (g) -> 2FClO$_2$ (g)

Rate = k\[F$_2$]$^x$\[ClO$_2$]$^y$ 

Calculate value of x and y

Comparing trial 1 and 3

Double \[F$_2$] with \[ClO$_2$] constant -> Rate doubles -> x = 1

Comparing trial 1 and 2

Quadruple \[ClO$_2$] with \[F$_2$] constant -> Rate quadruple -> y = 1

### Summary

- Reaction order is always defined in terms of reactant (not product) concentrations
- Rate laws are always determined experimentally
- The order of a reactant is not related to the stoichiometric coefficient of the reactant in the balanced chemical equation

### Concentration and rate

#### Chemical concept of a reaction

- 0 order = the change in concentration of that reactant does not change the rate of reaction
- 1st order = doubling the concentration causes the rate to double
- n$^{th}$ order = doubling the concentration causes a 2$^n$ increase in rate
- The rate constant **does not** depend on concentration
