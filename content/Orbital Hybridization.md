Introduced to this concept in [[AP Chemistry]]

## What is it

- All atoms except hydrogen will be hybridized atomic orbitals when bonded
- Determine the hybridization of a specific atom:
	- \# of lone pairs of electrons + \# of bonded atoms
	- *Double bonds do not make a difference*
- If the answer to the above question is
	- 2 = sp$^1$ (1 isn't necessary in Chemistry)
	- 3 = sp$^2$
	- 4 = sp$^3$
	- 5 = dsp$^3$
	- 6 = d$^2$sp$^3$
