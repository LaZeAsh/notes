## Example

At the very basic level it's a balanced equation

Example of thermochemical equation:

2 H$_{2(g)}$ + O$_{2(g)}$ -> 2 H$_2$O$_{(l)}$

$\triangle$ H = -571.6. kJ

Takeaway from this equation:

- 571.6 kJ of heat released per 2 moles of H$_2$ reacted
- 571.6 kJ of heat released per 1 moles of O$_2$ reacted
- 571.6 kJ of heat released per 2 moles of H$_2$O reacted
- Exothermic Reaction

## Sample Problem

How much heat is evolved when 266 g of white phosphorus (P$_4$) burn in air

*The world evolved in chemistry means released*

P$_4$ (s) + 5O$_2$ (g) -> P$_4$O$_{10}$ (s) 

$\triangle$ H$_{reaction}$ = -3013 kJ

Convert 266 grams of phosphorus to moles

266 grams of Phosphorus * $\frac{1 mol of Phosphorus}{123.88 grams of Phosphorus}$ = 2.147 mol Phosphorus

2.147 mol Phosphorus * $\frac{-3013 kJ}{1 mol of P_4}$ = -6469.31.. kJ ~ -6470 kJ (3 [[Significant Digits|sig digs]])
