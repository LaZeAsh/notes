I am writing this after watching Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul for the 2nd time

## Overview

Walter White, a chemistry teacher with cancer cooks and distributes methamphetamine to make money and gets busted by his own Brother-in-law.
## Walter White

The show was overall excellent, I loved the storyline but that's not why I am writing this note. I am writing this note to really take note of the underlying message which was who really is a bad person?

By no means does this justify the crimes that Walter, Jesse, Mike, or other characters commit but to me it goes to show the difference between a "bad" and a "good" person.

When we see someone who's in jail whether it be on the news or anywhere else we automatically assume it's a bad person who deserves what's going to happen to them. Although Walter's story doesn't strike me of someone who's a bad person. 

I cannot speak to his intentions later in the show but the reason he originally started cooking was because he had lost all hopes of beating cancer and wanted to leave money behind for his family. 

Maybe he changed enough throughout the show that he transitioned into a bad person?

Not exactly, he still tried to save Hank's life even if that meant giving up his $80 million and he tried to save Jesse until the very end when he sent him free.

## James Morgan McGill (aka Saul Goodman) 

Jimmy's reason for money had never been clear. Jimmy acquired money when he paid Lalo's bail, Sandpiper money (which never came through during the time period of the case), and more scenarios. This love for money but for what? I wondered what's the point of having so much money when you are going to have to work a job at a Cinnabon. 

This character is very interesting, I never thought I would use these words to describe the SAME person: Kind and Rascal. 

Jimmy is the more sensible person of his character, he was mainly in the beginning and near the end of the story where he realized that it was his responsibility to own up to who he really was.

Saul is the money hungry version of Jimmy, he acquired a lot of money but for what? That is still unknown to me.

Overall I believe Jimmy is a good character at heart although his character would be that much better if they explained what his goal with the money was. Power? Respect?
