## Types of solids

Ionic: Consists of Metal + non-metal has electrostatic attractions
Metallic: Consists of Metal and has metallic bonding


### Covalent Network

Exception: non-metal or metalloids covalent network, semi-metal with non metal is covalent network the only exception is bond with hydrogen as hydrogen can't bond any further

Network only happens with metalloid and has to be bonded with something other than hydrogen
