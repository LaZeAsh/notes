Introduced to this concept in [[AP Chemistry]]

## What is it?

- Measure of the change in energy of an atom when an e$^-$ is added to it
- If adding e$^-$ makes atom more stable, energy is given off (exothermic)
- If adding e$^-$ makes atom less stable, energy must be added (endothermic)
- Take the value of the free atom and the result and if the energy is lower energy it has released energy

F (g) + e$^-$ -> F$^-$ (g) $\triangle$ H = -328 kJ/mol
O (g) + e$^-$ -> O$^-$ (g)

As halogens gain electrons they become more stable
