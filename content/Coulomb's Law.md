## What is it

The effective nuclear charge increases across a period. Distance between nucleus and valence electrons increases down a group. It is more difficult to remove the 2nd electron from a +1 ion than to remove the 1st electron from a neutral atom.

The thing that's holding electrons around the nucleus is called the Coulomb's Law

Neutrons hold the protons together that want to repel each other

We can use Coulomb's Law to predict Ionization Energy

2 like charges = repel
2 unlike charges = attract

Ionization Energy - Amount of energy required to remove an electron

F = k $\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}$ (always going to be used conceptually not mathematically)
