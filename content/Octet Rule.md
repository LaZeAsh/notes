Introduced to this in [[AP Chemistry]]

Incomplete Octet: H, Be, B

Expanded Octet: Metalloid / Nonmetal elements in 3rd period and beyond

4 elements HAVE to have an octet: Carbon (C), Nitrogen (N$_2$), Oxygen (O$_2$), Fluorine (F)

## Rules

1. Give all atoms an octet
2. Place remaining pairs on 3rd period (& below) element - typically central atom

## Exception to Octet Rule

Row 3 and heavier nonmetals can have more than  electrons around them when they have to. Row 3 and heavier elements have empty  orbitals that are close in energy to valence  and  orbitals. These empty  orbitals can accept extra electrons.
