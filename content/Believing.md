If I don't believe in myself then who will?

## College Admissions

I always think that I won't get into any of the university I apply to but if I myself don't truly believe that then why will a total stranger believe me?

I think partially the reason is because I have acknowledged that there's someone better always out there, someone who's put more work, someone who's just better in every way possible and while that's true have I not put in any work?

Maybe a humble brag type of scenario but I have done my best to make the most of what I have, attended all of the hackathons I could, reach out to professors, put my best foot forward for the non-profits I am working for and other initiatives I have taken lead of.

If I have done all of that then I have nothing to be scared of, I actively try my best in everything I do.

So from this moment forward, November 5th 2023 10:52 PM I have decided I no longer want to believe yeah I probably won't get in or I am not cut out but rather believe that I need to continue putting my best foot forward and believe in myself and my skills that what I aim to achieve is truly possible.
