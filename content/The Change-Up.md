I watched this movie on 12/23/2023 for fun as I had some time

## What is it?

Movie is basically about 2 characters who's lives swap after they piss in a fountain together. It featured Ryan Reynolds and it's pretty funny, would give it a solid 8/10. It's good for passing time but I don't suggest it otherwise.

## Themes of the Movie

### Brutal Honesty

- When their lives are swapped a lot of their secrets are exposed, and family /  friends speak their honest thoughts about Dave when they think they're talking to Mitch and vice versa
- This makes them realize that they're doing something wrong and encourages them to do better themselves

This to me tells me how much better the world would be if people could take criticism and improve on their flaws. There's a fine line between something that could actually be improved vs changing yourself to satisfy others

### Imperfect life

Movie really emphasizes the point that no one's life is perfect, everyone has their own issues in their own path.

- Dave who's a successful lawyer finds no time to do what he wants and is constantly stressed with other issues with family
- Mitch who's employment is interesting to say the least is able to do whatever he wants but he instead smokes weed all day

After they switch lives they start to enjoy it initially but they realize for whatever reason their old one was better.

Similar to me and my move to Canada; grass is always greener on the other side and attempt to make the most of what you have

## Conclusion

Life has sacrifice; you sacrifice something to gain something else; If you personally don't then someone else did. Same concept as [[There is no such thing as a free lunch]].

At this stage of my life I am unsure on what to sacrifice and how much of it
