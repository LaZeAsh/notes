Process that gives off heat, transfers thermal energy from the system to the surroundings

## Examples

2H$_2$ (g) + O$_2$ (g) -> 2H$_2$O (l) + energy

H$_2$O (g) -> H$_2$O (l) + energy

In an exothermic reaction:
- The reaction vessel warms
- Heat is evolved (released)
- Energy is released by the system
- q is negative
