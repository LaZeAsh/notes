Introduced to this in [[AP Chemistry]]

## What is it

- Particles are in continuous random motion
- Between collisions particles have constant velocity and direction
- After collisions, particles have a new velocity and direction
- When particles collide, they don't stick - Elastic collisions
- Heavier particles move slower than the lighter particles
- Pressure is caused by particles colliding with the container walls

Does molecular size matter?
- Large volume particle will collide with each other and walls of the container more often as the gas is compressed and the spacing between particles becomes less and less
- Everyday containers are significantly larger than the gas particles os particle size becomes negligible
- Ideal gases assume that particles have zero volume, like mathematical points

- Summarizes the ideal behavior of gases
- Particles have random continuous motion
- Collisions are perfectly elastic (no stickiness)
- Particles have negligible volume
- Constant temperature = constant average kinetic energy
