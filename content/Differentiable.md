Definition: When a function is differentiable at all values of x in its domain, then it is said to be differential everywhere. A function that is twice differentiable is both differentiable everywhere and lim f''(x) as x approaches c exists everywhere

Rules for differentiability:

1. f is continuous at x = c
2. lim f'(x) exists at x -> c
