General meeting for [[Berkeley ASAE]]

Structures meeting this week!

## Overview

Structural configuration design decisions

- 4-part wing integration (as opposed to 5)
	- Easy Access into fuse with cargo door
	- Easier integration during manufacturing
	- Access to payload
	- Ease of transport
	- Alignment not huge issue with square spars & trusses
- Fuselage shape
	- Square with rounded corners
- Type of tail (Conventional or Boom)
	- Depends on CG
- Rolling Resistance
	- Physical test complete

## Fuselage

Proposal: Change in fuselage shape from circle to rounded square

- Larger overall fuselage
- Easier integration with wing, landing gear, and cargo door

### Stability and integration methods:

- Longerons extending from tail and fuselage
- Interlock with each other (every other longeron)
- Sliding lock mechanism
- Corner circled inserted into cutouts lock sliding tail / fuselage

## Boom Tail / Conventional Tail

Boom Tail - A type of rod or tubing that comes out of the fuselage and goes all the way to the back of the plane

Advantages:
- Easy integration
- Easy manufacturing
- Strong

Disadvantages:
- Weight (too heavy)
- Deflection

Conventional tail

Advantages:
- Very Lightweight
- Very strong

Disadvantages:
- Difficult integration method
- Difficult to repair if broken
- Difficult to manufacture
