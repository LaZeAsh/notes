## What is it?

Intramolecular Forces - attractive forces that hold particles together in ionic, covalent and metallic bonds
- Intra - within

Intermolecular Force - attraction between adjacent molecules
- Much weaker than intramolecular forces
- Forces that hold solids and liquids together
	- When a substance undergoes a phase change, intermolecular

bond energy = 431 kJ/mol
intermolecular attraction = 146 kJ/mol

### Dipole-Dipole Forces

- Forces that exist between neutral (no charge) polar molecules
- Attraction between $\delta^+$ and $\delta^-$ ends of different molecules

### Hydrogen Bonding

- Special case of dipole-dipole forces
- Requires H to be covalently bonded to one of the three most electronegative elements- F, O, or N
(hydrogen bonding is FON)
- creates a very polar bond (greater partial $\delta^+$ and $\delta^-$ charges)
- Strength:
	- hydrogen bonds > dipole-dipole bonds

### London Dispersion Forces (LDF)

- weak forces that result from temporary shifts in the density of electrons in the electron cloud
- At given points the electrons are not even distributed
	- Results in an instantaneous asymmetric e$^-$ distribution
		- Creates an instantaneous dipole moment
- The forces between instantaneous dipoles are called London Dispersion forces
- non-polar is always LDF
- Strengths (strongest to weakest):
	- Ionic
	- Hydrogen Bond
	- dipole-dipole
	- LDF
- Polarizability - the ease with which an electron cloud can be deformed
- More electrons = more polarizable -> more instantaneous dipoles -> more LDF's
- larger molecules (the greater the # of e$^-$) are more polarizable

## Trends
The stronger the forces between the particles:

- the higher the melting point.
    
- the higher the boiling point.
    
- the lower the vapor pressure.
    
- the greater the viscosity.
    
- the greater the surface tension.
