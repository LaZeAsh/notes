## Rules

1. Add total # of valence e$^-$ Add 1 for each negative charge. Subtract 1 for each positive charge
2. Divide by 2 = total # of bonds + lone pairs
3. Determine central atom, place 1 bond between central atom and terminal atom (outside atoms)
4. Determine the # of lone pairs for the terminal atoms and place them on atoms
5. Complete an octet for all atoms except hydrogen
