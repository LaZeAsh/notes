## Rules

1. Add total # of valence e$^-$ Add 1 for each negative charge. Subtract 1 for each positive charge
2. Divide by 2 = total # of bonds + lone pairs
3. Determine central atom, place 1 bond between central atom and terminal atom (outside atoms)
4. Determine the # of lone pairs for the terminal atoms and place them on atoms
5. Complete an octet for all atoms except hydrogen

Localized - This means that electrons belong to covalent bonds between two specific atoms

Resonance structures - structures which can be drawn in more than one way and are separated by double arrows

Resonance structures are a way to represent delocalized electrons that cannot be represented by a single lewis structure
## Bond Order

What is it?

Bond order is a measure of the number of shared electron pairs between two atoms in a molecule. It provides insight into the strength and stability of a bond.

Ayush's terms: Bond order is the number of bonds that are "shared" in the double bond / number of atoms
