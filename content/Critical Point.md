title: Critical Point

## What is it

A **critical point on** _**f**_ is a point where _f_ ′(_x_) = 0 or where _f_ ′(_x_) does not exist on the open domain of f. These points are called ‘critical’ because they identify places (_x_-values) where the graph of _y_ = _f_(_x_) **might** have a local maximum or a local minimum.

*Maximums and minimums can also occur on endpoints*
