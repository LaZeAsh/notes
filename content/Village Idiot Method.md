1. Vector (FBD) Diagram
2. Coordinate System
3. Resolve vectors into x & y components or (parallel and perpendicular)
4. X: F$_{net}$ = m$_{total}$ a$_x$ 
5. Y: F$_{net}$ = m$_{total}$ a$_y$ 

## Example Problem 

Helicopter Pilot and you want to take off 

m = 1150 kg 
a = + 3 $\frac{m}{s^2}$ 
F$_T$ = ?

We don't want the thrust to be equal to the weight as it'll just hover

If the helicopter is pushing air down according to Newton's 3rd law it's being pushed up

F$_{net}$ = m$_{total}$ a = F$_t$ - mg
