VSEPR - Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion

## Rules

Lone pair to Lone Pair repulsion is the greatest

Lone pair to shared pair / bond repulsion is 2nd greatest

Bond to a Bond (doesn't matter what type of bond) repulsion is 3rd greatest

## Polarity

Molecular polarity is all about the shape of the molecule it is different than bond polarity

SF$_6$ has electronegativity of 1.5 which is polar covalent

But when you look at the molecular structure you see that all forces cancel each other out you see that bond cancels each other out which is not what the E.N values was telling us

Symmetry = Non polar
