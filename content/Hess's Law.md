Introduced to this in [[AP Chemistry]]

## What is it

When reactants are converted to products, the change in enthalpy is the same whether the reaction takes place in one step or in a series of steps.

In simpler terms: The enthalpy change is the same either way if you take 1 step or multiple steps

State function: Doesn't matter how you get there only where you start and end

## Example

If the reaction is an endothermic reaction then the reverse reaction is always an exothermic reaction

Refer to [[Enthalpy]] for Endothermic and Exothermic reactions
