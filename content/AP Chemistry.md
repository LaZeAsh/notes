Learning logs will be in [[AP Chemistry Logs]]

[[Periodic Table of Elements]] - Mr.Hoffman Grade 11 Chemistry (Canada)

Use Ms.Morris's Chapter 4 - what to know to correlate what she teaches to AP Classroom

AP Chemistry curriculum was revamped in 2014

### Unit 1: Atomic structure and properties

- [[Average atomic mass]]
- [[Mole and Avogadro's number]]
- [[Isotopes]]
- [[Mass Spectrometry]]
- [[Empirical, molecular, and structural formulas]]
- [[Calculating mass percent]]
- [[Determining an empirical formula from percent composition]]
- [[Determining an empirical formula from combustion data]]
