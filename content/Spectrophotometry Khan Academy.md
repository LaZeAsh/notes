## Notes

I stands for light intensity

More concentrated a solution then that solution absorbs more light and transmits less light

Transmittance

T = $\frac{I(amount you got out)}{I(amount you put in)}$

Less transmittance = more opaque

If you are good at transmitting you are bad at absorbing, good at absorbing bad at transmitting

A = -log T = -log $\frac{I(amount you got out)}{I(amount you put in)}$ 

Beer Lambert Law - Absorbance is proportional to the path length

A = constant * length it has to travel * concentration
