I strongly dislike excuses, I don't use the term [[Hate]] as there's only a select few things I [[Hate]] 

## Opinions on Excuses

When I score bad on a test because I was tired, it doesn't say on my test "Ayush got a bad score because he was tired" but it says Ayush got a bad score. Excuses don't have a place in the real world and if anything I dislike the fact that there's a place for excuses.

The reason I dislike excuses and not *hate* excuses is because on the very off chance it's not that I have the right to make an excuse but rather it's understandable why someone would make one. 

For example, the passing of a family member. My Grandma passed away which I still to this day miss her, our connection was different she was a woman who served her duty of raising 2 incredible sons and 1 wonderful daughter. She went above and beyond and played a key role in shaping who I am. This was the first time I saw some of my family members cry. This is the reason why I [[Hard Work|work hard]] because my family has given up so much and worked hard to feed me to give me the opportunities and if I don't make the most of what I am provided I will be spitting on the efforts of the people that came before me. 

I believe everyone is entitled to their opinion but in my opinion if you're going to let a minor thing like getting a bad grade and use it as an excuse to look for an escape from your [[Duty]] and not to give your best in everything you do then I don't have any [[Respect]] for you

## Solution

Take [[Self Responsibility]] for your actions
