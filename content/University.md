No matter where I go for University I want to do A LOT in university, take every opportunity given to me.

Here are a bunch of ideas that come to me that I want to do in University

## [Whatever school accepts me] Car Club

A club where we the students buy fun / classic cars and rebuild them to learn about how car works. After a car has been rebuilt we make it so the club members can take them out for a certain period. There'll be a membership fee for the car club which'll cover things like insurance, parking, and future projects. This would be extremely fun and involve a lot of car enthusiasts.
