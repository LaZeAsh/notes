## Lead Weight / Car Demonstration

Because of newton's first law an object that is in motion stays in motion. That's why when you stop suddenly in a car you are launched forward

## Rubber Ducky Demonstration

When a rubber duck in water stops suddenly it goes backwards instead of forwards

If water wants to go forwards more (because it has more inertia) than the rubber ducky does then the water goes forward while rubber ducky goes backwards

## Coin and the Feather

Gravity accelerate things at 9.8

When dropping a hammer and feather hammer would fall first 

If you would like to make it fall at the same pace then you need to make a vaccum
