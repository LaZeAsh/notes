## Hints

Sometimes [[Christopher Gibbons|Mr.Gibbons]] drops hints before the unit test and I am going to write them here so I can review them the night before

- Graphical vectors will be on the test, although there's some leeway
- On Vector Components and Static Equilibrium lab Figure A is going to be on the test
	- Which force is balancing in the vertical direction
	- if F1$_y$ â‰  F2 then you're doing something wrong
	- F1y = F1 sin $\theta$
	- F1x = F1 cos $\theta$ 
	- F1y + F2y = W
	- y = sin $\theta$
	- x = cos $\theta$
- #4 and #5 are on the test on the vectors worksheet
- Static Equilibrium #1 on the test
- Instead of weight holding it down a balloon is pulling it up
