## What are they

Sets are similar to lists but they do NOT allow duplicates

To make a set:

```py
example_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}
# OR
example_list = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4]
list_set = set(example_list)
print(list_set) # This will print out {1, 2, 3, 4}
```

The example code segment should explain how sets in Python work
