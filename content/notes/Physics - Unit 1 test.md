**TEST ON FRIDAY 09/01/2023**
## Post-Test

I finished the test today at 09/01/2023, it was a fun test. I knew everything it was basically what we learned in class. I predict I will get a 100% on this test.

Future Tests:
- Bubble in answers as you're taking the test
- Focus more while you are doing the lab

Good takes:
- When I saw something I was a little doubtful of I didn't panic and kept a calm composure, I believe that helped me in this test
## Hints
V = $\Huge{\frac{\delta d}{\delta t}}$ = $\Huge{\frac{cm}{sec}}$ = answer $\Huge{\frac{cm}{sec}}$ 
Conversion sheet will be on the test

Sometimes [[Christopher Gibbons|Mr.Gibbons]] drops hints before the unit test and I am going to write them here so I can review them the night before

- On the Unit 1 test we're going to be given the graph of velocity and told to draw the graph of displacement and velocity using the graph of velocity
- Unit conversion might be density
	- Pay attention to the units on the unit test
- Graph on the test where we will have to find slope
- Precision and Accuracy on the test
- Difference between scalar & vector (1st couple unit tests)
- What's a hypothesis
- Most of physics stuff is from the summary page on the kinematics note
- Look at kinematics notes study that for the unit test
- "Read the graph"
- Hardest part of the test: 
	- Maximum total displacement in the positive & negative direction
- Acceleration, velocity, total displacement, distance covered, constant velocity
- Half the test is the Kinematics Graph Worksheet
- Steers clear of distance questions
- No slope on a tangent line on a velocity time graph
- How to find a slope on the tangent line (ON THE TEST)
- Will give a curve on a velocity time graph and ask for the instantaneous velocity at a point (need to know how to draw tangent line for that)
- 2 Speed Shifter Lab
- Test Practice Questions in class tomorrow

Unit 3 - 4 part calculation (if done without then you will get 1 point)
