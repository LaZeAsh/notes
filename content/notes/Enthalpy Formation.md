Introduced to this concept in [[AP Chemistry]]

## What is it?

The change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states is called "enthalpy of formation"

Forming a compound from it's individual elements

C(s) + 2S (s) -> CS$_2$ (l)

This would be an example of enthalpy of formation


Enthalpy of formation for any element in its standard state is zero
