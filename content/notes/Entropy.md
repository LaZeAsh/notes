Introduced to this in [[AP Chemistry]]

## Entropy of the Surrounding

$\triangle$ S$_{surr}$ (Entropy of the surrounding) depends on:
1. Heat flow of the rxn
	- Exothermic rxn - flow to the surrounding $\triangle$ S$_{surr}$ = (+)
	- Endothermic rxn - flow to the system $\triangle$ S $_{surr}$ = (-)
2. Temp. of surroundings:
	- Impact of the transfer of a given quantity of heat energy, will be great at lower temps (of the surroundings)
	- small change in entropy at high temps

$\triangle$ S$_{surr}$ (Entropy of the surrounding) = $\frac{quantityofheat}{temp}$ = $\frac{J}{K}$ 

At constant pressure, heat flow = $\triangle$ H

$\triangle$ S$_{surr}$ = - $\frac{\triangle H}{T}$ 

## Gibbs Free Energy: $\triangle$ G

use to determine if a rxn is `thermodynamically favored`

$\triangle$ S$_{univ}$ = $\triangle$ S$_{surr}$ + $\triangle$ S$_{sys}$ 

$\triangle$ S$_{univ}$ = - $\frac{\triangle H}{T}$ + $\triangle$ S

-T $\triangle$ S$_{univ}$ = $\triangle$ H - T $\triangle$S

| $\triangle$ G | Reaction                                |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| -             | thermodynamically favored (spontaneous) |
| zero          | equilibrium                             |
| +             | not favored (reverse rxn is favored)    |

$\triangle$ G = $\triangle$ H - T$\triangle$S

Provides us a thermodynamically favored reaction ALWAYS


## Thermodynamic and Kinetic Control (9.4)

- **Common misconception**: Thermodynamically favored reactions occur quickly
- Many favored reactions occur incredibly slowly (example: conversion of diamonds to graphite)
- These types of reactions are often slow because they have a high **activation energy**

### Example

C (diamond) $\rightarrow$ C (graphite)

- $\triangle$G$^\degree$ = -3 kJ
- Occurs spontaneously
- Does not require the input of any external energy to occur
- Incredibly slow, as in thousands of years slow
- Kinetically controlled

## Coupled Reactions (9.6)

- Thermodynamically unfavorable reactions do not occur on their own
- To make an unfavored reaction occur is through use of **coupled reactions**
- `Couple reactions` - a combination of a non favored reaction and a favored reaction that have a **common intermediate**

### Example

Fe$_2$O$_3$ + 3CO $\rightarrow$ 2Fe + 3CO$_2$:

Fe$_2$O$_3$ $\rightarrow$ 2Fe + 3/2O$_2$
- $\triangle$G$^\degree$ = 742.2 kJ

CO + 1/2O$_2$ $\rightarrow$ CO$_2$ 
- $\triangle$G$^\degree$ = -283.5 kJ
