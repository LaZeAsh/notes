Nash equilibrium is a situation where no player could gain by changing their own strategy 

Nash equilibrium is a defensive strategy that cannot be beaten, but also does not take advantage of opponents

## Key points of Nash Equilibrium:

1. Each player's strategy is the best response to the strategies of the other players. No player has an incentive to deviate
2. All players are choosing the strategies that are the best response to each other
3. No single player can improve payoff by changing their strategy alone

## Real World Example

$\begin{array}{c|c|c} & \text{B: Cooperate} & \text{B: Defect} \\ \hline \text{A: Cooperate} & (3, 3) & (0, 5) \\ \hline \text{A: Defect} & (5, 0) & (1, 1) \\ \end{array}$

We have this matrix and based off the responses we can conclude this:

- if Player B cooperates, Player A's best response is to defect (get 5 instead of 3)
- if Player B defects, Player A's best response is to defect (getting 1 instead of 0)
- if Player A cooperates, Player B's best response is to defect (get 5 instead of 3)
- if Player A defects, Player B's best response is to defect (get 1 instead of 0)

Both players always cooperating or defecting is the example of Nash Equilibrium neither player can increase their payoff unless they change their strategy together
