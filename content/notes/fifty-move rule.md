fifty-move rule in chess states that a player can claim a draw if no capture has been made and no pawn has been moved in the last fifty moves ("move" is consists of a player completing a turn followed by the opponent completing a turn). Purpose of this rule is to prevent a player with no chance of winning from continuing to play indefinitely or seeking win by tiring the opponent.
