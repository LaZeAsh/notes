How neural networks learn.

Gradient Descent is a powerful optimization algorithm used to train Machine Learning models with the objective of minimizing the [[Cost Function]].

## Analogy

The way you train a computer to do better is by insulting it, when training the network you mention to the computer what it should be and compare it what the computer returned and tell it to do better. I loved this analogy from the 3Blue1Brown video loool
