Gradient Descent is a powerful optimization algorithm used to train Machine Learning models with the objective of minimizing the [[Cost Function]].

## Analogy

Imagine going down a mountain blindfolded, your goal is to find the lowest point in the area. Gradient descent is feeling the ground to determine the steepest descent and taking steps to reach the lowest point
