Important Terms for the course Math 135 at the [[University of Waterloo]]

1. Sets - [[Set Notation]]
2. `Statement` - a sentence that has the definite state of being true or false
	1. 2 + 3 = 6 (false statement) | $\pi$ + 2 $\geq$ 5 (true statement)
	2. Does 7 = 5? (not a mathematical statement because you cannot assign true or false to it)
3. `Natural Numbers` denoted by $\mathbb{N}$ 
4. Set of `integers` where negative, positive, or zero are denoted by $\mathbb{Z}$
5. Set of `rational numbers` denoted by $\mathbb{Q}$ contains all the numbers of the form $\frac{a}{b}$ where a is an integer and b is a non-zero integer
6. Set of `real numbers` denoted by $\mathbb{R}$ contains all the numbers in decimal form
7. `Negation` - Finding the inverse meaning of a statement
	1. Suppose A is a true statement, $\neg$ A would be false
		1. $\neg$ ($\neg$ A) = A
8. `Quantified Statements` contains 4 parts:
	1. A quantifier
	2. A variable (any symbol representing a quantity or mathematical object)
	3. a domain (any set)
	4. an open sentence involving the variable
9. `Open Sentence` - A sentence that contains a variable, where the truth of the sentence is determined by the value of the variable chosen from the domain of the variable
10. `Quantifiers` - Describe "how many" elements of the domain are claimed to make the open sentence true
11. $\forall$ - Universal Quantifier
12. $\exists$ - Existential Quantifier
13. `Universally Quantified Statement` - $\forall$ x $\in$ S, P(x)
	1. This statement is read as "For all x in S, P(x) is true"
14. `Existentially Quantified Statement` - $\exists$ x $\in$ S, P(x)
	1. This statement is read as "There exists at least one value of x in S for which P(x) is true"
