title: "Physics - Unit 14 Test"
---

1. When light goes from low index of refraction to high index of refraction it bends towards the normal
2. High to low bends away from the normal
3. There will be a question about semi-circle about how ray goes in it refracts but when it goes out it doesn't refract
	1. going to see this at least 3 times
5. You can see a fish in a tank 3 times, and at none of those places are where the fish actually is
	1. Probably going to be some little baby seal question
6. oscilloscope (50 MCQ on the final day)
7. 1 - 2 questions about dispersion
	1. Dispersion - Different colors refract different amount
8. P. R51 # 139 on the test
	1. wont be as complicated
9. When an object has an index of refraction similar to the medium it's in the object seem to disappear
10. 3 Lens on this unit's FRQ
11. Alaadin's head doesn't seem to be connected to his torso


## Demonstrations

### Prism

- Light goes in prism, it refracts and it comes out in a different position

### Semi-circle prism

- Light goes in it refracts but it comes out at the same angle as it goes in

### Double Rainbow

- In the top one red's on the bottom and bottom one red's on the top

### Mirage

- Hot air has a higher index of refraction than cold air
- This causes a refraction of light which causes light to pile up
