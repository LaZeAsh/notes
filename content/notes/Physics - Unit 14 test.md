1. When light goes from low index of refraction to high index of refraction it bends towards the normal
2. High to low bends away from the normal
3. There will be a question about semi-circle about how ray goes in it refracts but when it goes out it doesn't refract
4. You can see a fish in a tank 3 times, and at none of those places are where the fish actually is


## Demonstrations

### Prism

- Light goes in prism, it refracts and it comes out in a different position

### Semi-circle prism

- Light goes in it refracts but it comes out at the same angle as it goes in
