## What is it?

A formation reaction is when all the reactants (left side of the equation) are elements and the coefficient for the single product (there can only be 1 product) must be 1. 

To have the coefficient of 1 for the product you may need to use fractional coefficients for the reactants

When 1 mole of compound is formed with elements in their standard states it's known as [[Enthalpy Formation]]

## Example of Formation Reaction

C (s) + O$_2$ (g) -> CO$_2$ (g)

$\triangle$ H = -393.5 kJ

C (s) + $\frac{1}{2}$ O$_2$ (g) -> CO (g)

$\triangle$ H = -110.53 kJ
