Static Friction is stronger than Kinetic Friction

F$_Fmax$ = M$_s$ * F$_N$ 

- F$_F$ = Friction Force
- M$_s$ (Mue) = Coefficient of friction (static)
- M$_k$ (Mue) = Coefficient of friction (kinetic)
- F$_N$ = Normal Force

When doing maximum calculations of static friction you use the max value as you need a very very small number to move 

Kinetic and Static Friction are related
