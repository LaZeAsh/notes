Supervised Learning is a subcategory of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. It is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms that classify data or predict outcomes accurately


As input is fed into the model supervised learning adjusts the weights until the model has been fitted appropriately

## How it works

Supervised Learning uses a training set to yield the desired output. This includes the correct inputs and outputs which allows the model to learn overtime. Accuracy is measured through the loss function, adjusting until the error has been minimized.

Supervised learning can be separated into two types of categories:

- `Classifcation`: An algorithm accurately assigns test data into specific categories
