A Gradient is a fancy word for a [[Derivative|derivative]] or the rate of change of a function. A [[Vectors|vector]] (a direction to move) that:
- Points in direction of greatest increase of a function
- Is zero at local maximum or local minimum

Term gradient is for functions with multiple inputs and one output. A line technically has a gradient (the slope of the line) but using gradient for single variable functions is unnecessarily confusing.
