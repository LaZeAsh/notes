I met Guillermo Rauch in San Francisco at a Fireside Chat where he talked about his experience as an immigrant to the United States.

I loved this talk it was very relatable to me as an immigrant how my life has changed because of me being an immigrant and often having less opportunities because I am one.

**All of the keypoints or Q&A in this note is not Guillermo's words I have cut down**

## Key Takeaways from his talk

I was not taking notes during his talk (something I should start doing in the future) so I will try to recall his points best I can

- Writing down your thoughts; He says to always write down your thoughts as an essay and this will help you formulate your ideas better and putting it out there
- If your product is not getting traction even after you make it open source and do sufficient advertising then it probably does not have a space in the market (being stubborn vs perseverance)
- Used a soccer analogy about working as team; At one point Argentina Soccer (Football) team always passed the ball to Messi and had him figure it all out but they won their first world cup when the whole team worked together
- Stop blaming others; He noticed that in History they were always told that Argentina's problem were because of others. As you move away from this mindset and start taking action for your own problems
- There have been a lot of setbacks for him, he still made a space for himself in the US even though he was a High School dropout 
- Be good enough at a concept to teach others, by doing this you'll have a better/deeper understanding of it.

### Questions I asked!

Q: I am 18, pretty early career, two years ago I was focused on getting an internship and now I am in San Francisco seeing what's possible such as building my own startup. As you keep reaching higher points the more ambitious your goals get, how do you know when it's enough? Is it ever enough? If not, what keeps you going?

A: I don't spend a lot of time celebrating, I probably should be. I set a goal for myself that's achievable mathematically and I am never near that goal. My biggest competition is me.

Q: How can I stay in touch with you if I need to ask a question

A: You can get in touch with anyone you want using twitter (X) if you give them good insight about their product or you link/make something cool. A reputable business man reached out to me and he's now the biggest user of Vercel.
