- `Electric Field` - Force field that exists around an electrically charged object
- E = $\frac{F}{q_o}$
	- magnitude of electric field = force on positive charge / amount of charge
	- SI Units: N/C
- F = qE
	- force = amount of charge x electric field
	- SI Unit: N
	- `Equation gives magnitude AND direction to find magnitude only use F = |q|E`
- E = k$\frac{|q|}{r^2}$ 
	- magnitude of electric field = k |charge|/(distance)$^2$
- `Electric Dipole` - A system consisting of a positive and a negative charge
- `Parallel-Plate Capacitor` - A device consisting of two parallel plates (separated by a finite distance) that have opposite charges
