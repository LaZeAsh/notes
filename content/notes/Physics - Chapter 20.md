## 20.1

- `Electric Field` - Force field that exists around an electrically charged object
- E = $\frac{F}{q_o}$
	- magnitude of electric field = force on positive charge / amount of charge
	- SI Units: N/C
- F = qE
	- force = amount of charge x electric field
	- SI Unit: N
	- `Equation gives magnitude AND direction to find magnitude only use F = |q|E`
- E = k$\frac{|q|}{r^2}$ 
	- magnitude of electric field = k |charge|/(distance)$^2$
- `Electric Dipole` - A system consisting of a positive and a negative charge
- `Parallel-Plate Capacitor` - A device consisting of two parallel plates (separated by a finite distance) that have opposite charges
- `Charging by Induction` - The charging of an object without direct contact

## 20.2

- `Electric Potential Energy` - Mechanical work that is stored as electrical energy
- `Electric Potential` - The charge in electric potential energy for a given amount of charge
	- change in electric potential = change in electric potential energy / charge
	- $\triangle$ V = $\frac{\triangle PE}{q}$ 
	- SI Unit: joule/coulomb = volt (V)
- `Connection between the Electric Field and Electric Potential`
	- electric field = - change in electric potential / distance
	- E = - $\frac{\triangle V}{d}$ 
	- SI Units: volts / meter (V/m)
- Electric potential decreases in the direction of the electric field 
- Energy is conserved in electrical systems
	- KE$_A$ + PE$_A$ = KE$_B$ + PE$_B$
- `Electric Potential for a Point Charge`
	- electric potential = k $\frac{charge}{distance}$
	- V = k$\frac{q}{r}$
	- SI Unit: Volt (V)

## 20.3

- `Capacitor` - A device that has the capacity to store electric charge and electrical energy
- `Definition of Capacitance, C`
	- capacitance = charge / electric potential difference
	- C = $\frac{Q}{V}$ 
	- SI Unit: coulomb / volt = farad (F)
