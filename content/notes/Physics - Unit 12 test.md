title: "Physics - Unit 12 test"
---

- 2 FRQ problems, 1 will be doing the electric field lines and second is going to be drawing magnetic field lines
- 1 question is about earth's magnetic field lines
- FRQ Question # 2, draw a horseshoe magnet
- Generator and motor elements going to be on the test we have to identify
- Will ask on the test what inductors do
	- Inductors resist current flow change
- Back EMF questions
- Tangent Galvinometer - 


## Demos

- Dropping a magnet down an aluminum pipe; Magnets underneath repel and above attract therefore it comes down slowly. As magnet is moving it's creating an induced current in the pipe
	- Eddy currents
- 

## Practice

1. Do the practice questions he put on the board
2. Review homework
3. Review demos
4.
