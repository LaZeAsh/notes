I really like the song Whatever it takes by Imagine Dragons!

Favorite Line(s):

Yeah, take me to the top, I'm ready for 

Whatever it takes  

'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins  

I do what it takes

## Why I like it

I want to do whatever it takes to achieve my goals. If someone convinced me that by following their lead I can achieve what I want, I'd do whatever it takes.

Also this song gets me really hyped whenever I listen to it!
