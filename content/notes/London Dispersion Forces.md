## What is it?

When two non-polar species are temporarily attracted to each other when induced dipoles form

London dispersion forces are the temporary attraction between the nuclei of one atom or molecule to the electrons of another atom or molecule.

This attraction occurs because electrons are not always in the same location and sometimes they are in positions that result in temporary dipoles. **Even though the molecule itself is non-polar**.

These dipoles result in attractive forces between molecules.
