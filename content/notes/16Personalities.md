16Personalities is a quiz that asks you a series of questions and gives you a chart of what kind of person you are

## My Personality

16 Personalities classified me as `ENTJ-A` (Commander)

According to their website this is what that means:

### Strive for Greatness

 - Commanders believe that given enough time and resources they can achieve any goal
 - At the negotiating table whether it's a corporate environment or buying a car Commanders are dominant, relentless, and unforgiving
 - Someone who can stand to Commanders intellectually earns their respect

- Commanders call out other's failures with a degree of insensitivity and that's their downfall

### A Worthy Challenge

- Commanders distance from their emotions especially in public 
- Commanders will crush the sensitivities of those they view as inefficient, incompetent, or lazy
- Commanders adopt a perspective of 'Fake it till you make it'
- If Commanders are able to combine an emotionally healthy focus alongside their many strengths, they will be rewarded with deep, satisfying relationships and all the challenging victories they can handle.

## Personal Opinion

I was told by [[Steven Gong]] to take this test, I for one am not to believe in tests like these but this does sound awfully a lot like me. There are some things I disagree with such as crushing sensitivities of those who I view as inefficient, incompetent, or lazy but for the most part I think this is a somewhat accurate representation of me.

Good work!
