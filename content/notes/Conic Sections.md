title: "Conic Sections"
---

Conic sections include circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas and represent curves that are formed when a plane intersects a right-circular cone as shown in the figure.

## Ellipse

`Formula for ellipse:` $\frac{x^2}{a^2}$ + $\frac{y^2}{b^2}$ = 1

When a = b it yields a circle of r (radius) = a

## Hyperbola

`Formula for hyperbola:` $\frac{x^2}{a^2}$ - $\frac{y^2}{b^2}$ = 1

The hyperbola is going to have `x-intercept` OR `y-intercept` not both

Special case when xy = 1
