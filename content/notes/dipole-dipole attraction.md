## What is it?

If a molecule is polar, the positive end of one molecule will be attracted to the negative end of another molecule.

Since the dipoles are permanent, unlike the temporary dipoles responsible for the London dispersion force, the attraction between polar molecules is much stronger than the attraction between similarly sized non-polar molecules.

The diagram here shows two ways that polar molecules can be aligned to cause an attraction between them.
