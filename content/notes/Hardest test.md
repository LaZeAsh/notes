Hardest test related to academics I have taken in my LIFE


## 05/03/2024

Today we had the Physics reflection test, this test is historically known to be easy. It's supposed to be those tests near the end of the year that everyone passes and gets a grade boost which I desperately need at this time.

ALTHOUGH, I am not sure but [[Christopher Gibbons|Mr.Gibbons]] made this test insanely hard. 50 MCQs + 4 FRQs with the whole period to do it (57 minutes but with starting of class and all we only get 50-53 minutes). I sat there doing the test thinking how many hard questions on reflections can he really ask. Oh boy, I underestimated his ability to turn what seemed to be simple into hard and confusing. It gets to a point where even if you think you know the answer you second guess yourself. 


I am unsure what I got on this test but I will be sure to update the score here once I get the test back...

I have also been telling my friends that if I was the type of person to cry during a test (no offense to those who do I just don't do it) then this would be the test I'd be balling my eyes out on the whole time...

Hope this is the worst and my last 2 physics tests of the year are better
