## Properties of Matrix Multiplication

> [! Properties of Matrix Multiplication]
> 
> Let c $\in \mathbb{R}$ and A, B, C be matrices of appropriate sizes. Then:
> 
> a) IA = A | I is an identity matrix
> 
>b) AI = A | I is an identity matrix
> 
>c) A(BC) = (AB)C | Matrix multiplication is associative
>
>d) A(B + C) = AB + AC | Left distributive law
>
>e) (B + C)A = BA + CA | Right distributive law
>
>f) (cA)B = c(AB) = A(cB)
>
>g) (AB)$^T$ = B$^T$ A$^T$


## Pre-Requisite

The column of matrix 1 being multiplied and the row of matrix 2 being multiplied have to be the same for this operation to even be possible
**Order matters**
AB $\neq$ BA

## Rule

Use the direction $\Rightarrow$ $\Downarrow$ 

### Example

## Result
Results in a matrix with the row of the 1st matrix and the column of the 2nd matrix
