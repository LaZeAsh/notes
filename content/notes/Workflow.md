What tools are part of my workflow?

## Coding tools

- VIM (keybinds to help me code faster)
- Git (committing code)
- Visual Studio Code (IDE)
- Terminal (quick actions such as to download packages create files and more)
- Bracket Colorizer (before it became a default option in VSCode)
- POSTMAN (to test APIs)

## Online Resources

- Documentation
- GPT-4
- Stack Overflow
- Reading blogs

## Virtual Machines

- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure free linux virtual machines

## Building Solutions

1. Really understand what I am being asked
2. Think of tech stack
	1. Personally comfortable with Python as there are ample resources for it
3. Focus on a specific aspect to start off and make sure it's working
	1. Example if I have to build an API make sure that it's working with POSTMAN so if an issue arises in the future it's with something else and not my backend
4. I really prioritize isolation in my code so I will incorporate the use of different files and clearly lay out their purpose
