A set is a collection of distinct elements, also considered an object. Each object in a set is called an element (member) of the set.



Key points about sets:

1. Distinct Elements: Each element in a set is unique. No two elements are the same within a set
2. Order Irrelevance: The order which elements are listed in a set does not matter. For example, the sets {1, 2, 3} and {3, 2, 1} are considered the same
3. Notation: Sets are typically denoted by curly braces. For example, N = {i$_1$, i$_2$, ..., i$_k$} could represent a set of players, where each i$_j$ is a **distinct** player

## Type of Sets

Empty Set: The empty set, denoted by $\emptyset$ or {}, is a set with no elements
- Example: $\emptyset$ = {}
Finite Set: Set with finite number of elements
- Example: {1, 2, 3}
Infinite Set: Set with infinite number of elements
- Example: N = {1, 2, 3, ...}
Subset: Set A is a subset of set B if all elements of A are also elements of B, denoted A $\subseteq$ B
- Example: {1, 2} $\subseteq$ {1, 2, 3}
Proper Subset: set A is a subset of set B if A $\subseteq$ B and A $\neq$ B denoted A $\subset$ B
- Example: {1, 2} $\subset$ {1, 2, 3}
Universal Set: Set that contains all possible elements for a particular discussion, usually denoted by $\cup$ 
- Example: N $\cup$ {1, 2, 3}
Power Set: The set of all subsets of a set A, including empty set and A itself, denoted P(A)
- Example: A = {1, 2}, then P(A) = {$\emptyset$, {1}, {2}, {1, 2}}

## Set Operations

1. Union: The union of two sets A and B is the set of elements that are in A, in B, or in both, denoted A $\cup$ B
	- Example: {1, 2} $\cup$ {2, 3} = {1, 2, 3}
2. Intersection: The intersection of two sets A and B is the set of elements that are in both A and B, denoted A $\cap$ B
	- Example: {1, 2} $\cap$ {2, 3} = {2}
