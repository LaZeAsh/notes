## 23.1

- `Electromagnetic Induction` The process of inducing an electric current in a circuit using a changing magnetic field
- The term `flux` means flow
- `Magnetic Flux` - measure of number of magnetic field lines that pass through a given area
- Definition of a Magnetic Flux
	- magnetic flux = magnitude of magnetic field x area x cos $\theta$
	- SI Unit: T x m$^2$ = weber (Wb)
- Magnetic flux depends on the magnitude of the magnetic field, it's orientation, and the area of the surface
- Faraday's law of induction
	- induced emf = -(# of loops) (rate of change of magnetic flux)
	- $\epsilon$ = -N $\frac{\triangle \phi}{\triangle t}$
- Lenz's law states that an induced current always flows in a direction that opposes the change that caused it

## 23.2
