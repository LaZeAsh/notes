## 7.1

- Momentum = mass x velocity 
	- $\overrightarrow{p}$ = m$\overrightarrow{v}$ 
	- SI units: kg x $\frac{m}{s}$
- Object's momentum changes whenever its mass or velocity changes
- Magnitude of Momentum = mass x speed
	- p = mv
	- SI Units: kg x $\frac{m}{s}$
- p and $\overrightarrow{p}$ is sometimes referred to as linear momentum
- $\overrightarrow{p}_{total}$ = $\overrightarrow{p}_{1}$ + $\overrightarrow{p}_{2}$ + $\overrightarrow{p}_{3}$ ...

## 7.2

- Product of a force and time over which it acts is defined as `impluse`
	- impulse = force x time interval
	- $\overrightarrow{I}$ = $\overrightarrow{F}$ $\triangle$ t
	- SI Units: N x s = kg x $\frac{m}{s}$
- In cases where direction isn't important we can use `magnitude of force` and `magnitude of impulse`
	- magnitude of impulse = magnitude of force x time
	- I = F$\triangle$ t
	- SI Units: N x s = kg x $\frac{m}{s}$
- When a force acts on an object it changes the object's momentum, thus there's a connection between impulse and momentum change
	- General form of Newton's second law is expressed in terms of momentum as follows: $\overrightarrow{F}$ = $\frac{\triangle \overrightarrow{p}}{\triangle t}$
	- This is how newton originally said `force is equal to the rate of change of momentum`
- `Momentum-Impulse Theorem` 
	- impulse = force x time = change in momentum
		- $\overrightarrow{I}$ = $\overrightarrow{F}$ $\triangle$ t = $\triangle$ $\overrightarrow{p}$ = m $\triangle$ v

## 7.3

- Momentum of an object can't change unless an external force acts on the object
- If total force is zero then the initial and final momentums must be the same, which is known as momentum conservation
- Internal Forces - Forces that act between an object between a system
- External Forces - Exerted on a system by something outside the system
- Only **external** forces can change a system's momentum, internal forces have no effect
- $\overrightarrow{F}_{total}$ = $\sum$ $\overrightarrow{F}_{int}$ + $\sum$ $\overrightarrow{F}_{ext}$ 
	- Total force = sum of internal forces and external forces
- Internal forces ALWAYS sum to zero
- $\overrightarrow{F}_{total}$ = $\sum$ $\overrightarrow{F}_{ext}$
	- Since internal forces always sum to zero the external forces equal the sum of forces
- Momentum-impulse theorem: $\overrightarrow{F}$ $\triangle$ t = $\overrightarrow{p}_{f}$ - $\overrightarrow{p}_{i}$

## 7.4

- Even though momentum is conserved during a collision doesn't mean that kinetic energy is conserved as well
- Collisions are categorized according to what happens to the kinetic energy of the system, 2 possibilities whether it's conserved or not
- Elastic Collisions: Collision in which kinetic energy is conserved (unchanged)
- Inelastic Collisions: Kinetic energy changes as a result of the collision
	- Energy is typically converted to sound, heat, and deformation
- Completely inelastic collisions: objects stick together after colliding
- Momentum conservation applies to all collisions
- Total momentum of 2 objects is the sum of mass times velocity for each object
- Equation: $\overrightarrow{P}_{total}$ = m$_1\overrightarrow{v}_1$ +  m$_2\overrightarrow{v}_2$
