title: Physics - Unit 7 Test
---

- Pulley System on the test
- Ideal mechanic advantage by using diagram of pulleys
- PE + KE = PE' + KE' for the FRQ of the test
- Where did the energy go?
	- Sound, Heat, Friction, Deformation
- Work in 
- Work out
- Potential Energy
- Kinetic Energy
- Which quantity is affected by friction: F$_r$ 
- We don't use machine to do less work
	- We do more work overtime
- Couple of questions from Penguin, Monkeys, Etc lab

## Page O' Notes

- If a rock is thrown then it has a kinetic energy at the top
- KE = $\frac{1}{2}$m(v)$^2$
- PE = mgh
- PE $\frac{1}{2}$k(x)$^2$ 
	- k = spring constant
	- x = how much the spring has moved
- m$_1$v$_1$ + m$_2$v$_2$ = m$_1$v$_1$' + m$_2$v$_2$'
	- Recall the bullet problem in the homework packet
- $\triangle$ KE = KE$_f$ - KE$_i$
- KE$_R$ = $\frac{1}{2}$(I)(W)$^2$
- W = F(d) (Joules)
- W = F(d)(cos$\theta$)
- P = $\frac{work}{t}$ (watts)
- Conservation of energy equation:  
- Momentum = mass x velocity
- AMA = MA = $\frac{F_r}{F_e}$
- IMA = F$_r$d$_r$ = F$_e$d$_e$ -> $\frac{F_r}{F_e}$ = **$\frac{d_e}{d_r}$
- efficiency = $\frac{MA}{IMA}$ * 100%
- solid ball vs hollow ball
	- solid gets down the hill first; smaller moment of inertia
	- hollow = rotational
	- solid = translational
