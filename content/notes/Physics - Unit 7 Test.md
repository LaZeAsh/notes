- Pulley System on the test
- Ideal mechanic advantage by using diagram of pulleys
- PE + KE = PE' + KE' for the FRQ of the test
- Where did the energy go?
	- Sound, Heat, Friction, Deformation
- Work in 
- Work out
- Potential Energy
- Kinetic Energy
- Which quantity is affected by friction: F$_r$ 
- We don't use machine to do less work
	- We do more work overtime
