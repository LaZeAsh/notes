## 15.3

- `Polarization` - The direction of the electric field in a light wave or any other electromagnetic wave
- `Polarizer` - A filter that transmits light waves with only on direction of polarization
- Unpolarized light can be polarized by passing it through a polarizer
	- The intensity of polarized light is 1/2 of the original intensity
	- I$_f$ = $\frac{1}{2}$I$_i$
- Polarizer affects both intensity and polarization of light
- Law of Malus
	- I$_f$ = I$_i$cos$^2\theta$
- Reflection also causes polarization
