## 10.1

- Temperature is proportional to the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance
- The sum of all kinetic and potential energy is referred to as internal or `thermal` energy
- Thermal energy goes from hot objects to cool objects
- A system is in `Thermal Equilibrium` when its temperature is constant and there is no net transfer of energy
- `Heat` is the energy transferred between objects because of a temperature difference
- Fahrenheit temperature = $\frac{9}{5}$ (celsius temperature) + 32
- Celsius temperature = $\frac{5}{9}$(Fahrenheit temperature - 32)
- Lowest possible temperature is known as `absolute zero`
	- Absolute zero can be approached but never attained

## 10.2

- $\triangle$ L = (constant) $\triangle$ T
- change in length = coefficient of thermal expansion x initial length x temperature change
- Energy must be added or removed from an object in order to change its temperature and cause it to expand or contract
- `Conduction` is a form of thermal energy transfer that occurs through collisions between particles of matter
