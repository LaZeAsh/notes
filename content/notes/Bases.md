Refer to [[Acid-Base Theories]] if needed
## Arrhenius Model

Strong base

- Acids produce H$^+$ in aqueous solution
- Bases produce OH$^-$ in aqueous solution

## Bronstead-Lowry Model

Weak base

- Acids are H$^+$ donors
- Bases are H$^+$ acceptors

## Dissociation of Strong Bases

MOH$_{(s)}$ $\rightarrow$ M$^+_{aq}$ + OH$^-_{aq}$

- Strong bases are metallic hydroxides
	- Group I hydroxides (NaOH, KOH) are very soluble
	- Group II hydroxides (Ca, Ba, Mg, Sr) are less soluble
- pH of strong bases is calculated directly from the concentration of the base in solution
	- 0.10 M NAOH = 0.10 M OH$^-$
- Formula for Calcium Hydroxide: Ca(OH)$_2$ 

## Reaction of Weak Bases with Water

The base reacts with water producing its conjugate acid and hydroxide ion:

CH$_3$NH$_2$ (aq) + H$_2$O (l) $\leftrightarrow$ CH$_3$NH$_3^+$ (aq) OH$^-$ (aq)

CH$_3$NH$_3^+$ - Conjugate Acid

OH$^-$ - Hydroxide ion

K$_b$ = 4.38 * 10$^{-4}$ = $\frac{[CH_3NH_3^+][OH^-]}{[CH_3NH_2]}$ 

All weak bases do this - DO NOT try to make this complicated
