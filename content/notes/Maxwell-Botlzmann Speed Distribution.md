Introduced to this in [[AP Chemistry]]

When reading this graph make sure to look at x and y values to see what you're looking at

Area under the curve represents the total number of particles (learned in [[AP Calculus AB]])

## Patterns

Temperature and Gas Particle average velocity has a proportional relationship

Ayush's terms: $\uparrow$ Temperature = $\uparrow$ Avg Velocity


Molar mass and gas particle average velocity has an inverse proportional relationship

Ayush's terms: $\uparrow$ Molar Mass = $\downarrow$ Avg Velocity
