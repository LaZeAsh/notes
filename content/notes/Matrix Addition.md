title: "Matrix Addition"
---
## Pre-Requisite

The matrix must have the same dimensions (so same # of rows and same # of columns)


## How?

If the dimensions are the same you add 1 element from the other in the order it was given

Let A = $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 5 & 6 \end{bmatrix}$

Let B = $\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 3 & -2 \\ -3 & 4 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$

A + B = $\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 5 & 1 \\ 1 & 9 & 7 \end{bmatrix}$

In this example the elements are being added with their corresponding element
