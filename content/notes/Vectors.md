## Vectors Terminology


2 or more vectors can be added to make 1 vector which is called the resultant

Vector quantities: displacement, velocity, acceleration, force, and more

## Vector Rules

- Vectors are added tip to tail
- Angles are always measured from the tip 0 degree and not from prev vector direction

To draw vectors follow these rules:

1. Establish an appropriate scale (example: 1cm = 5 N).
2. Draw 0O reference line and starting point.
3. Draw first vector from starting point.
4. Re-establish 0O reference line, add next vector to the tip of
the previous vector.
5. Repeat step 4 for all vectors to be added.
6. Draw resultant. Measure direction and magnitude of
resultant and label it. For *Forces find equilibrant (180O from
and same magnitude as resultant) if required.
