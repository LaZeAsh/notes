## Travel

This was the first time I had travelled this far by myself for this long to go to an event. I was really excited to say the least, living by myself for almost a week surrounded by people who love doing what I do.

## Experience

This was a very interesting experience to say the least, being quite a bit different from hackathons I have attended in the past
## Accommodations

I slept on a couch for this whole event. Say what you want but for $15 / night I got a great deal.
