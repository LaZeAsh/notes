title: "Collision Theory"
---

Introduced to this in [[AP Chemistry]]

## What is it?

A theory that particles must collide with one another to react

Particles need to have enough energy and speed to react in addition to colliding

Minimum energy for a reaction to occur is activation energy

Temperature is the active kinetic energy of the particles

Orientation is another factor for some reaction, they have to be at the correct angle for them to react

### Summary

1. Particles must collide to react
2. Sufficient energy to break and make bonds
3. Must collide with the correct orientation
