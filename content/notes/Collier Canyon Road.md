First drove on this road on March 9th, 2024

Pretty fun road to drive on had quite a bit of twists and straight portions

Definitely would do this again only complaint may be that the road itself has a little too many bumps but other than that I love it. I did this road at night so I didn't see many people, I am unsure if it's the same during daytime.
