August 11, 2020 - May 31st, 2024

I attended high school for ~4 years and I believe that high school played a significant part in who I am today so it's only fair to document my experience!

*I am going to be sharing a lot of cringy/embarrassing photos of myself which I am probably going to regret but I think it'll be good to look back on :)*
## 9th Grade (2020 - 2021)

9th Grade (Freshman Year) was an interesting start to high school. As most people know that this is the school year where we all went remote and were locked up in our homes. My family lived in a 2 bedroom apartment at the time and since my whole family was in remote meetings throughout the day it was a bit packed but we managed. 

This was the time in my life where I paid 0 attention to online school and just played games. I played way too much Fortnite and Roblox alongside looking up memes all day on the internet. I remember it being so bad at one point that I was using acronyms such as "wtf" and "lol" in my professional (school) writing. This was also the year that I picked up programming and started developing Discord Bots. I went from someone who knew nothing about programming to meeting people who taught me (my guy James who spent so much time teaching me) basic JavaScript to learning more and more advanced concepts by continuing to work on my Discord Bot.

2nd semester of Freshman year had gone hybrid at Foothill High School which meant my parents forced me out of the house. It was a good decision, I preferred going to school in-person rather than staying at home all day. My GPA thanked me for it. 1st Semester GPA: 3.00 vs 2nd Semester GPA: 3.43

## 10th Grade (2021 - 2022)

My freshman year came and left, nothing eventful happened (got in trouble once though) just normal school alongside me starting my new hobby as a programmer by working on my Discord Bot.

10th Grade (Sophomore Year) however was very eventful in comparison to Grade 9, so eventful that I have decided to split this section into two, 'USA' and 'Canada'.

### USA

10th Grade started like normal, school had gone back to fully in-person this year, no more of the hybrid system (bye bye lovely 9 AM - 12 PM school days). As my first in-person year of school I started 

I went to class and came back home alongside a few things on the side (eg: volunteering at my Middle School's Pancake Breakfast). Semester 1 of High School wasn't the best as I wasn't performing as well as I wanted academically nor was I doing anything outside of school that I was proud of. I was just being me, going to school, coming back home, and playing games.
