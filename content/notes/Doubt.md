As i'm writing this I am waiting at UC Berkeley for [[Berkeley ASAE]]

## Grade 12

At this stage in my life, I am having a lot of doubt: Am I good enough? Other people have this and that. Maybe I am not cut out for this.

No one is born cut out for anything. Everyone has to work hard to become something. As someone who always talks about doing your best, I feel slightly hypocritical thinking about this, but I have realized that it is normal to feel doubtful. The answer to overcoming doubt is simply to do what you have always done: put your 100% into everything you do.

I am at a stage where decision day is fast approaching and I am not sure what my decision is going to be accepted or rejected but what I know is no matter the decision I will continue doing what i've been doing. Putting my 100% into everything I do.
