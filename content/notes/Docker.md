Essentially Docker is an environment management tool that allows you to run your application on multiple different environments and manages all conflicts.

Book Definition: Docker is a tool which is used to automate the deployment of applications in lightweight containers so that applications can work efficiently in different environments

This would have been lovely to have during CalHacks where I spent most of my time trying to fix my environment for my image generation application

## Docker Client and Server

Contains of 2 main components:
- Docker Client: The primary way users interact with Docker, it provides a command line interface (CLI) for running commands and communicating with Docker Daemon
- Docker Server (Docker Daemon): Component responsible for managing Docker objects, such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. Listens for API requests from Docker Client and executes requested actions
