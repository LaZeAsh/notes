## Lead Weight / Car Demonstration

Because of newton's first law an object that is in motion stays in motion. That's why when you stop suddenly in a car you are launched forward

## Rubber Ducky Demonstration

When a rubber duck in water stops suddenly it goes backwards instead of forwards

If water wants to go forwards more (because it has more inertia) than the rubber ducky does then the water goes forward while rubber ducky goes backwards

## Coin and the Feather

Gravity accelerate things at 9.8

When dropping a hammer and feather hammer would fall first 

If you would like to make it fall at the same pace then you need to make a vaccum

## Bird Demonstration

Bird (1 kg) in a jar (2 kg) and it's not touching anything (floating)

No air is going in or out

What's the jar's weight in newtons?

It depends on the stage if the bird is falling down and it pushes the air down then it pushes itself up. If all of the air makes it down then it'll be 30 newtons otherwise it'll be slightly less.

If the weight is 20 newtons then the bird would get cooked

Air resistance generates heat we just don't notice it
