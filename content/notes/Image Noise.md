Image noise usually manifests itself as random speckles on a smooth surface which affects quality of the image.

Learned about Image Noise when building [[Rubiks]]

3 types of image noises

## Random Noise

Fluctuation of the colors above the actual intensity of the image
## Fixed Pattern Noise

Appears after long exposures and high temperatures
## Banding Noise

Camera is reading data from the sensor and it directly relates to the in-camera technology factors

To remove image noise you can try

## [[Gaussian Blur]]

Gaussian Blur tends to remove high frequency noise while at the same time it'll soften edges heavily. 

## Median filter

Median Filter in Photoshop preserves edges and works best when dealing with noise with high spatial frequency. 

## Actions and Presets

Many presets available for Photoshop and Lightroom
