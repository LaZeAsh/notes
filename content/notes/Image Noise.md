Image noise usually manifests itself as random speckles on a smooth surface which affects quality of the image.

Learned about Image Noise when building [[Rubiks]]

3 types of image noises

## Random Noise

Fluctuation of the colors above the actual intensity of the image
## Fixed Pattern Noise

Appears after long exposures and high temperatures
## Banding Noise

Camera is reading data from the sensor and it directly relates to the in-camera technology factors
