The three elementary row operations are:

- (Row Swap) Exchange any two rows
- (Scalar Multiplication) Multiply any row by a constant
- (Row Sum) Add a multiple of one row to another row

## Comments on Combining Elementary Row Operations (2.5)

It is encouraged to combine elementary row operations when we're using one row to modify the others

Avoid multiple row operations in the same step. This would still be correct but is discouraged since there's more room for error
