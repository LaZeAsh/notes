ControlNet is a [[Neural Networks|Neural Network]] model for controlling Stable Diffusion models. 

Learned this at the UC Berkeley AI Hackathon 2024

ControlNet uses many concepts I have already learned such as [[Canny Edge Detection]]

## Canny Edge Detection Example

ControlNet uses [[Canny Edge Detection]] to get the outline of the image + a prompt that it uses to generate an image. It's more of a fill in for the image
