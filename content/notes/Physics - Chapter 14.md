## 14.1

- Sound wave is formed when an oscillating object creates alternating regions of compressed and expanded air
- Speed of sound wave depends on what it moves through
- The speed of sound depends on the "stiffness" of the material it's passing through
	- Stiffer material = faster sound wave
- Speed of sound is same for all directions of travel and for all frequencies
	- v = $\lambda$f
	- speed = wavelength x frequency
- `Pitch` - pitch of a sound is the frequency of the corresponding sound wave
- `Infrasonic` - Sound frequencies less than 20 Hz
- `Ultrasonic` - Sound frequencies greater than 20,000 Hz
- `Beats` - Result of two waves interfering with one another
- `Beat Frequency`- Difference in frequency between two original waves
	- f$_{beat}$ = | f$_1$ - f$_2$ |
	- SI Unit: 1/s = s$^{-1}$

## 14.2

- `Standing Wave` in bottle must have a node at the bottom and an antinode at the top
- First harmonic = f$_1$ = $\frac{v}{\lambda}$ = $\frac{v}{4L}$ 
- `Standing Waves` also form in pipes that open on both ends
	- They must have an antinode at each end of the pipe

## 14.3

- `Doppler Effect` - Source of sound moves toward an observer and the frequency heard is higher than the frequency produced by the source
	- Occurs with all types of waves not just sound waves 
	- Doppler effect is basically that waves will be stronger around the source
	- f$_{observer}$ = $\frac{f_{source}}{1 \pm \frac{v_{source}}{v_{sound}}}$ 
		- Doppler effect for a moving source
		- + for moving away from the observer
		- - for moving toward the observer
		- SI Unit: Hz = s$^{-1}$ 
	- Observer of doppler effect hears higher frequency when approaching the source and a lower frequency when moving away from the source
	- f$_{observer}$ = f$_{source}$ (1 $\pm$ $\frac{v_{observer}}{{v_{sound}}}$ )
		- + for observer moving toward the source
		- - for observer moving away from the source
		- SI Unit: Hz = s$^{-1}$ 

## 14.4

- `Intensity` - Amount of sound energy passing through a given area in a given time
	- intensity = $\frac{energy}{area * time}$
	- intensity = $\frac{power}{area}$
		- SI Units: $\frac{W}{m^2}$
- Intensity decreases with distance from the source
	- Sound spreads out over a larger area as it moves away from it's source hence reducing the intensity
- Increasing by a factor of 10 
- `Decibel (dB)` - Unit used to measure loudness (1/10th of a bel) 
- Doubling loudness of sound increases intensity by factor of 10 corresponding to an increase of 10 dB
- `Intensity Levels` - Loudness of a sound given in decibels
