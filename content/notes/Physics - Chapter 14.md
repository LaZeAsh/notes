## 14.1

- Sound wave is formed when an oscillating object creates alternating regions of compressed and expanded air
- Speed of sound wave depends on what it moves through
- The speed of sound depends on the "stiffness" of the material it's passing through
	- Stiffer material = faster sound wave
- Speed of sound is same for all directions of travel and for all frequencies
	- v = $\lambda$f
	- speed = wavelength x frequency
- `Pitch` - pitch of a sound is the frequency of the corresponding sound wave
- `Infrasonic` - Sound frequencies less than 20 Hz
- `Ultrasonic` - Sound frequencies greater than 20,000 Hz
- `Beats` - Result of two waves interfering with one another
- `Beat Frequency`- Difference in frequency between two original waves
	- f$_{beat}$ = | f$_1$ - f$_2$ |
	- SI Unit: 1/s = s$^{-1}$
