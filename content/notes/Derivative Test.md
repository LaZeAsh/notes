## First Derivative Test

First derivative test is when f' changes from negative to positive at x = a or positive to negative (has a minimum or maximum)

If `f` has a local minimum at `x=a` on domain $(b,\ c)$,  $f'\left(a\right)=$ **0** or **undefined**, and f'$\left(x\right)$**changes from negative to positive.**
## Second Derivative Test

If f'(a) = 0 and f''(a) > 0 then f has a Minimum

If f'(a) = 0 and f''(a) < 0 then f has a Maximum

If `f` has a local minimum at `x=a` on the domain $\left(b,\ c\right)$ $f'\left(a\right)=$ **0** and $f''\left(a\right)$**> 0**.
