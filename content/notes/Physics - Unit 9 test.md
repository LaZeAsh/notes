2. Picture of wave which you have to label
3. Big things tend to vibrate at low frequencies and small things tend to vibrate at higher frequencies
4. Test will look like 2nd page of superposition worksheet
	1. Frequency, wavelength, and amplitude
	2. Going to ask for numbers on the test
5. Draw 3 waves and the reflected wave
6. Superposition
7. Draw the paths of the 3 rays and 1 refracted rays
8.
