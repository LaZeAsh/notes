- `Concave Mirror` - Mirror that curves inwards
- `Convex Mirror` - Mirror that bulges outwards
- `Center of Curvature` - Center of the sphere of which the curved mirror is a section
- `Principal Axis` - Drawn through the center of curvature and the midpoint of a curved mirror
- `Focal Point` - The point at which rays reflecting from the surface of a mirror converge
- `Focal Length` - The distance from surface of the curved mirror to the focal point
- Focal length for a Concave Mirror with radius (R)
	- focal length = $\frac{1}{2}$ x radius of curvature
	- f = $\frac{1}{2}$R
	- SI Unit: m
