title: "Value"
---

Value can be positive or negative, it comes in various forms, and everyone provides some to someone or something.

More value $\neq$ being a better person; but rather how much BS people are willing to tolerate from you before calling it quits
## My point

Everyone you meet, you seek positive value from them just as they seek positive value from you. Value can be but doesn't have to be monetary.

Examples:
- [[University of Waterloo]] values my business
- I value the reputation given to me solely based on attending the [[University of Waterloo]]
- I value the friendship and the company provided by a friend
- I give value to [[JAMHacks]] by being an organizer
- A thief values monetary valuables of another person

## Origin of thought

I started thinking about the concept of value when a friend prompted me to consider what others thought of me. During this I effectively came to the conclusion that if I had not put as much effort into things I enjoy, which others value, then I would not be in the position I am in right now.

## Exception to Value

I firmly believe that the concept of value is real and understanding it will help you understand better how the world works. 

However, I think the only exception to the rule of value are the people who sacrifice for you, notably parents. Parents sacrifice a lot to bring you into this world, raise you, and putting your happiness before theirs. For most, the relationship between a parent and their child can never be replicated. 

There are very few people out there who'd truly put someone else's needs ahead of their own.
