## 13.3

- Wave - disturbance that propagates or is transmitted from place to place carrying energy as it travels
- Waves travel place to place but particles in a wave oscillate 
- `Transverse Wave` - particles oscillate at right angles to the direction wave travels
- `Longitudal Waves` - particles oscillate parallel to the direction of propagation
- $\lambda$ = Wavelength = distance over which a wave repeats
	-  SI Unit: m
- speed = $\frac{wavelength}{period}$
	- v = $\frac{\lambda}{T}$
- speed = wavelength x frequency
	- v = $\lambda$f
	- SI Unit: $\frac{m}{s}$
- `Medium` - Any type of matter such as air, water, or steel
- `Mechanical Waves` - travel through matter

## 13.4

- `Resultant Wave` - 2 or more individual waves that overlap and as a result combine
- `Principle of Superposition` - Resultant wave is sum of individual waves that make it up
- `Constructive Interference` - When waves combine to form a larger wave
- `Destructive Interference` - When waves superpose to form a smaller wave
	- Used to reduce noises in factory, busy offices, and even airplane cabins
- Interference is one of the key characters that define waves
- `Standing Wave` - A wave that oscillates in a fixed location
- `Nodes` - Points on a standing wave that do not move
- `Antinode` - Maximum displacement between any 2 node points
- 

## 14.1

- Sound wave is formed when an oscillating object creates alternating regions of compressed and expanded air
- Speed of sound wave depends on what it moves through
