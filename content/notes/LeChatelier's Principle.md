title: "LeChatelier's Principle"
---

Once a system is at equilibrium it'll stay at equilibrium unless `stress` is applied in which case the reaction rates will no longer be equal. The system will attempt to re-establish equilibrium at which point forward and reverse reactions will be the same. 

Le Chatelier's Principle allows us to predict how the system will respond in order to re-establish equilibrium after stress has been applied.

TLDR: When a stress is applied to a system at equilibrium, the system will respond to relieve/undo the stress.

## Left or Right

Stresses that cause a system at equilibrium to shift:

Right:
- Adding Reactants
- Removing products

Left:
- Adding Products
- Removing Reactants
