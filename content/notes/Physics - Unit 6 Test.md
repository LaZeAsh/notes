1. On the test he's going to ask where the center of gravity / center of mass is. if it's not moving it's a vertical line 
2. Diagram will be given on the test and you have to label it
3. Zero side of the meter stick is the side without the mass, the 100 side is the side with the mass
4. F$_1$D$_1$ = F$_2$D$_2$
5. Closed = no mass enters or leaves the system 
6. Isolated = no external forces act on the system; no energy enters or leaves the system
7. Bowling ball FRQ
8. Multiple FRQs on the test
9. "Recipe" for the test on momentum notes page
10. 1 question about impulse momentum equation

	2. After: 0
	3. How fast is the canoe going?
15. Conservation of mass
16. Write the equation for the conservation of momentum
