title: "Titrations"
---

Introduced to this in [[AP Chemistry]] and Grade 11 Chemistry (Rick Hansen Secondary School)

## What is it

In titrations a solution in a buret is gradually added to another solution until the chemical reaction between the two solutions is complete

`Equivalence Point` - The point when the rxn is complete (calculated)

`Indicator` - substance that changes color at the **endpoint**

`Endpoint` - the approximate time where the color has changed (general)

`Indicator` - Substance that changes color at endpoint

## Example: Strong Acid and Strong Base

A solution of HCl is titrated with NaOH

### Step #1: What is in solution?

H$^+$ $\cancel{Cl^-}$  $\cancel{Na^+} OH$^-$ 

Ignore Cl and Na

### Step #2: Write an equation to consume the strong acid/base

OH$^-$ + H$^+$ $\rightarrow$ H$_2$O

## Strong Acid-Strong Base Titrations


## Example: Weak Acid and Strong Base

A solution of Acetic Acid, HC$_2$H$_3$O$_2$, is titrated with NaOH

### Step #1: What is in solution?

H$^+$  C$_2$H$_3$O$_2$  $\cancel{Na^+}$  OH$^-$

### Step #2: Write an equation to consume the strong base

OH$^-$ + HC$_2$H$_3$O$_2$ $\rightarrow$ C$_2$H$_3$O$_2$ + H$_2$O

### Weak Acid-Strong Base Titrations

CH$_3$COOH (aq) + OH$^-$ (aq) $\rightarrow$ CH$_3$COO$^-$ (aq) + H$_2$O (l)

*pH will be slightly above 7 which lets us know weak acid and strong base*


## Example: Weak Base and Strong Acid

A solution of ammonia, NH$_3$, is titrated with HCl

### Step #1: What is in solution?

NH$_3$  H$^+$  $\cancel{Cl^-}$ 

### Step #2: Write an equation to consume strong acid

NH$_3$ + H$^+$ $\rightarrow$ NH$_4^+$


### Step #3: 


## Summary

- Strong Acid vs. Strong Base
	- 100% ionized pH = 7 No equilibrium
- Weak Acid vs Strong Base
	- Acid is neutralized; Need K$_b$ for conjugate base equilibrium pH > 7
- Strong Acid vs Weak Base
	- Base is neutralized; Need K$_a$ for conjugate acid equilibrium pH < 7


## Titration Problems - finding the pH of the solution

1. Write the net ionic equation
2. Stoichiometry problem - react the strong acid/base
	1. Moles (or millimoles = Molarity x mL)
3. Equilibrium, if a weak acid or base is present
	1. ICE table (Molarity)
	2. [[Henderson-Hasselbach Equation]] (Molarity)
4. Calculate pH

## Titration - strong acid + strong base

What is the pH at different points during the titration of 50.0 mL of 0.100 M HCl and 0.200 M KOH

### Step #1: What is in solution

H$^+$ $\cancel{Cl^-}$

### Step #4: no acid/base reaction

$\therefore$ pH = -log(0.100) = 1.000


What is the pH at different points during titration of 50.0 mL of 0.100 M HCl and 0.200 M KOH

### Step #1: What is in solution

H$^+$  $\cancel{Cl^-}$  $\cancel{K^+}$  OH$^-$

### Step #2: Write a net ionic equation to react strong acid/base

OH$^-$ + H$^+$ $\rightarrow$ H$_2$O

What is the pH at different points during titration of 50.0 mL of 0.100 M HCl and 0.200 M KOH

*After addition of 25.0 mL of KOH*

### Step #1: What is in solution

H$^+$ $\cancel{Cl^-}$ $\cancel{K^+}$ OH$^-$ 

### Step #2: Write a net ionic equation to react strong acid/base

OH$^-$ + H$^+$ $\rightarrow$ H$_2$O

### Step #3:
