## 22.1

- End of a freely rotating bar magnet that points towards the north geographic pole of the earth is the north pole
- The opposite end of the magnet is south pole
- Breaking a bar magnet produces new poles making a north and south
- `Magnetic Field` - Force field that surrounds any magnetic material
- North geographic pole of Earth is near the south pole of Earth's magnetic field
- `Magnetic Domain` - A region within a magnetic material where the electrons are aligned in the same direction

## 22.2

- Stationary electric charge produces an electric field but not a magnetic field, As you move the charge magnetic field is generated
- Magnetic field for a long straight wire
	- B = $\frac{\micro _0I}{2\pi r}$
	- SI Unit: Tesla (T)
- Wires with currents in the same direction experience an attractive force
- Wires with currents in the opposite direction experience a repulsive force
- `Solenoid` - Electrical Device in which a long wire is wound into a succession of closely spaced loops
- `Magnetic Field of a Solenoid`
	- B = $\micro _0$ ($\frac{N}{L}$)I
	- SI Unit: Tesla (T)

## 22.3

- `Magnitude of the Magnetic Force, F`
	- force = |charge| x velocity x magnetic field x sin $\theta$
	- F = |q|vBsin$\theta$ 
	- SI Unit: Newton (N)
