Introduction Link: https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/introduction/

gRPC a client application can directly call a method on a server application on a different machine as if it were a local object. This makes it easier to create distributed applications and services

gRPC clients and servers can talk to each other in a variety of environments - from servers to inside your own Desktop

By default gRPC uses [[Protocol Buffers]], Google's mature open source mechanism for serializing structured data (although other formats like JSON are still supported)
