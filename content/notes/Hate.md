title: "Hate"

I don't use the term "hate" often, hate is a very strong word and in my opinion should be used in very minimal terms

## Things I hate

Now that I have discussed my opinions on hating these are the things I hate

1. Losing
2. I dislike many things in life but the one thing I hate is when people blame others for their own incompetence
	1. Reasoning for this being is when you do something wrong in life, example get a bad grade what benefit do you get from blaming the teacher? Nothing, the teacher is doing their job they don't care if you get an A+ or a F, in fact they would prefer if every student passed as it would display that they're good at what they do.
