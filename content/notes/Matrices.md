## Math 115 Notes

The m x n matrix with all zero entries is called a **zero matrix**, denoted by 0$_{m x n}$, or simply by 0 if the size is clear

> [! Fundamental Properties of Matrix Algebra]
> 
> Let A, B, C $\in M_{m \cdot n}(\mathbb{R})$ and let c, d, $\in \mathbb{R}$. We have
> 
> M1. A + B $\in M_{m \cdot n}(\mathbb{R})$ | $M_{m \cdot n}$ is closed under addition
> 
> M2. A + B = B + A | addition is commutative
> 
> M3. (A + B) + C = A + (B + C) | addition is associative
> 
> M4. cA $\in M_{m \cdot n} (\mathbb{R})$ | $M_{m \cdot n} (\mathbb{R})$ is closed under scalar multiplication
> 
> M5. c(dA) = (cd)A | Scalar multiplication is associative 
> 
> M6. (c + d)A = cA + dA | distributive law
> 
> M7. c(A+B) = cA + cB | distributive law


Let A $\in M_{m \cdot n}(\mathbb{R})$. The **transpose** of A, denoted by A$^T$, is the n x m matrix satisfying (A$^T$)$_{ij}$ = (A)$_{ji}$

> [! Properties of Transpose]
> 
> Let A, B $\in M_{m \cdot n}(\mathbb{R})$ and c $\in \mathbb{R}$. Then
> 
> a) A$^T$ $\in M_{n \cdot m}(\mathbb{R})$
> 
> b) (A$^T)^T$ = A
> 
> c) (A + B)$^T$ = A$^T$ + B$^T$
> 
> d) (cA)$^T$ = cA$^T$



## Notation
- A = reference to matrice
- a = element
- a$_{12}$ = refers to element in matrice A 1st row 2nd column
- a$_{23}$ = refers to element in matrice A 2nd row 3rd column

## Rules

When calculating size of matrix it goes row x column

In this direction $\Rightarrow$ $\Downarrow$ 

## Types of Matrices

Zero Matrix:

All positions (elements) are 0

Identity Matrix:

Has 1 in diagonals and everything else is 0
