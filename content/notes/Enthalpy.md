Enthalpy (H) is used to quantify the heat flow into or out of a system in a process that occurs at constant pressure

In other words Enthalpy equals Heat

$\triangle$ H$_{rxn}$ = H$_{products}$ - H$_{reactants}$ 

$\triangle$ H$_{rxn}$ = heat released or absorbed during a reaction at constant pressure

Endothermic:
(Surroundings get cooler)
H$_{products}$ > H$_{reactants}$ 

$\triangle$ H > 0; +

Exothermic:
(Surroundings get warmer)
H$_{products}$ < H$_{reactants}$

$\triangle$ H < 0; -

Surroundings:

- A flask is a surrounding for the solution inside of it
- If we hold a flask we're the surroundings
