title: "Rubiks"
draft: true

Personal project I am working on, logs on how I made this are in [[RubiksCube-AI Logs]]

Use reinforcement learning
## Features

- Analyze cube and say how hard it was to solve
- Lowest # of moves
- 
## Important Links
- [YOLO NAS](https://learnopencv.com/category/object-detection/)
- 

## What

Project's purpose is to develop a program that uses OpenCV analyzes a Rubiks Cube and gives the user instructions on how to solve it

## Algorithms to Solve Rubiks Cube

There are multiple algorithms that can be used to solve a rubiks cube
