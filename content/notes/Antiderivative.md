## What is it?

Antiderivative of a function f is a function F whose derivative is f. $\frac{d}{dx}$ F(x) = f(x)

Ayush terms: basically the derivative of this function with equal f(x)

Notation for antiderivative of function f(x) is F

Since there are an infinite number of antiderivatives that differ with the constant we use the constant "C" to represent them all.

This form is known as the general antiderivative
