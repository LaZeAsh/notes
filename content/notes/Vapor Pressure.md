Introduced to this in [[AP Chemistry]]

## What is it?
Vapor Pressure: Pressure exerted by the vapor of a liquid (or solid) when condensation and vaporization are in dynamic equilibrium

Vapor pressure is a physical property that's a result of IMFs

*for AP Chemistry we're going to be focusing on liquids not solids*

Rate of vaporization = rate of condensation

## Vapor Pressure (Molecular Level)
Vapor Pressure on the Molecular Level
- Some molecules on the surface of a liquid escape the attraction of the IMFs: liquid -> gas phase
- These gas molecules collide with the container creating a pressure
- After some time the pressure will be constant = vapor pressure
- Dynamic Equilibrium: The point when as many molecules escape the surface  as strike the surface and return to the liquid layer
- P$_{vap}$ = $\triangle$ Height (mmHg)

## Volatility and Vapor Pressure

- Volatile substances evaporate rapidly
	- Liquid with high vapor pressure
- In general molecules with greater molar mass have lower vapor pressure - why?
	- Molecules with higher molar mass need more energy to be evaporated which results in less vapor pressure
	- Less vapor pressure means that the IMFs are strong
	- Moris's comments:
		- State a specific IMF not a general IMF
		- Explain why more molar mass leads to more IMF
		- Tie it back to Vapor Pressure
	- Sample Answer:
		- More polarizable (don't have to use this) -> more instantaneous dipole moments -> increased LDF ->  molecules stay in the liquid phase, so lower vapor pressure
