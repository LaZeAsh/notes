title: Factors affecting Solubility

## Structure

- "like dissolves like" DOES NOT SUFFICE AS AN ANSWER ON TEST (SHOCKER!)
- Two substances with similar intermolecular forces are likely to be soluble in each other
	- Too Generic need to be more specific
- Non-polar molecules are soluble in non-polar solvents
	- ex. CCl$_4$ in C$_6$H$_6$ (hydrocarbons are non-polar)
- Polar molecules are soluble in polar solvents
	- CH$_3$OH in H$_2$O
- Ionic compounds are soluble in polar solvents
	- NaCl in H$_2$O (ion-dipole interactions)
- Why can't hydrogen bonding mix with something that disperses LDFs
	- 3 types of IMFs: Hydrogen (strongest), Dipole-Dipole, LDFs
	- In order to break IMFs it requires energy
	- Making IMFs it gives out energy
	- If we're breaking hydrogen bonds and making LDF that doesn't work because net energy isn't 0 therefore cannot bond

## Effect of Structure on Solubility

Water - Universal Solvent
hydrophilic - polar; tends to dissolve ionic compounds and polar molecules
Hydrophobic - non-polar 

## Pressure Effects

- Pressure has little effect on solubility of solids and liquids
- Pressure does affect the solubility of gases in liquids
- Henry's law: relation of pressure and solubility of gases (NOT TESTED ON EXAM)

## Temperature and Solubility

- Solubility decreases with increasing temperature

## Density and Molar Mass

- Relation between density and molar mass
- As molar mass increases density increases
-
