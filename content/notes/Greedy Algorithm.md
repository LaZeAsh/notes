Learned Greedy while solving Codeforces problem Domino Piling (50A)

## Definition

 An algorithmic paradigm that follows the problem solving approach of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum

## Pros 

- Simple, easy to implement, fast
- You always get a solution

## Cons 

- Very often doesn't provide a globally optimum value

## When to use?

1. A global optimum can be arrived at by selecting a local optimum
2. An optimal solution to the problem contains an optimal solution to subproblems
