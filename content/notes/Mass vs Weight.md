Introduced to this in [[Physics]]

To get weight you multiply mass by 9.8 (gravity of the earth)

W = Mass x gravity

Since earth has a very large mass it exerts a very large force of attraction

## Weight vs Mass

Apple, golf ball, and battery all have a mass of 100 grams

Force of gravity acting on them is 1 Neuton (pulled down by the force of 1 Newton)

Use Newton's Spring Scale to measure the force 

Number of newtons = 1/10th of a kilogram

Mass stays the same wherever you go

Gravity changes on the moon that's why your weight changes
