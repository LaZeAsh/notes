## What is it?

The enthalpy change required to break a covalent bond in one mole of gaseous molecules is the bond energy

Ayush term: 

As bonds occur either by sharing or transferring it's because it achieves a noble gas configuration which makes it stable

Creating of a bond is exothermic

Breaking of a bond is endothermic

**General Rule: Single Bond < Double Bond < Triple Bond** 

Another way to find Enthalpy of Formation:

$\triangle$ H = $\Sigma$ n BE (broken) - $\Sigma$ n BE (formed)
Sum of number of broken molecules * Bond energy - Sum of number of formed molecules * Bond Energy

- n = moles of broken molecules
- BE = bond energy
