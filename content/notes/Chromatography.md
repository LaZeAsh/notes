Introduced to this concept in [[notes/AP Chemistry|AP Chemistry]]

## What is it?

Chromatography is a separation technique based on their solubility

- More soluble in water travels longer distance on Chromatography paper
- Less soluble travels shorter distance on Chromatography paper

Retention Factor (R$_f$) = $\frac{distance travelled by a component}{distance travelled by a solvent}$ 

Higher Retention Factor = More soluble in the solvent

Smaller Retention Factor = Less soluble in the solvent
