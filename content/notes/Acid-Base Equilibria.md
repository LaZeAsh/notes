Introduced to this in [[AP Chemistry]]

## Common Ion Effect

`Common ion effect` - The shift in equilibrium caused by the addition of a compound having an ion in common with the solute

The presence of a common ion **decreases** the ionization of a weak acid or a weak base

### Example

CH$_3$COONa and CH$_3$COOH:

CH$_3$COONa (s) $\rightarrow$ Na$^+$ (aq) + CH$_3$COO$^-$ (aq)

CH$_3$COOH (aq) $\leftrightarrow$ H$^+$ (aq) + CH$_3$COO$^-$ (aq)

**CH$_3$COO$^-$** (aq) is a common ion

## Buffer Solution

`Buffer Solution`- Resists a change in pH when H$^+$ or OH$^-$ ions are added

Buffer Solution consists of:
1. A weak acid AND its conjugate base
2. A weak base AND its conjugate acid

A pair MUST be present otherwise it's not a buffer solution

### Example

CH$_3$COOH (aq) $\leftrightarrow$ H$^+$ (aq) + CH$_3$COO$^-$ (aq)

Adding a strong acid causes a shift left and the ratio of conjugates slightly changes

Applying the ideology of [[LeChatelier's Principle]]

**Always consider ratio of conjugates when doing buffer solution**

If ratio of conjugates the pH changes
