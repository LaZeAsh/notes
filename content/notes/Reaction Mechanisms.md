Introduced to this in [[AP Chemistry]]

The overall progress of a chemical reaction can be represented at the molecular level by a series of simple elementary steps or elementary reactions

## What is it?

The sequence of elementary steps that leads to product formation is the `reaction mechanism`

*This comes after experimental data has been collected*

### Example

2NO (g) + O$_2$ (g) $\rightarrow$ 2NO$_2$ (g)

N$_2$O$_2$ is detected during the reaction

Elementary step: NO + NO $\rightarrow$ N$_2$O$_2$
\+ Elementary step: N$_2$O$_2$ + O$_2$ $\rightarrow$ 2NO$_2$
\---------------------------------------
Overall reaction: 2NO + O$_2$ -> 2NO$_2$ 

### Reaction Mechanisms

- The balanced chemical equations provides information about the beginning and of rxn
- A `rxn mechanism` explains how reactants rearrange to form new products
- Mechanisms provide a very detailed picture of which bonds are broken and formed during the course of a reaction
- Derived from experimental data

### Reaction Intermediates

`Intermediates` are species that appear in a reaction mechanism but not in the overall balanced equation

An `intermediate` is always formed in an early elementary step and consumed in a later elementary step

Elementary Step: NO + NO $\rightarrow$ N$_2$O$_2$ 
\+ Elementary Step: N$_2$O$_2$ + O$_2$ $\rightarrow$ 2NO$_2$
\---------------------------------------
Overall Reaction: 

## Rate Laws and Determining Steps

*Determining a plausible reaction mechanism*

- The sum of the elementary steps must give the overall balanced equation for the reaction
- The rate-determining step should predict the same rate law that is determined experimentally

The `rate-determining` step is the slowest step in the sequence of steps leading to product formation

## Rate Laws and Elementary Steps

Slow Elementary Step:
- Unimolecular reaction A $\rightarrow$ Products rate = k\[A]; rate = k\[A]
- Bimolecular reaction A + B $\rightarrow$ products; rate = k\[A]\[B]
- Bimolecular reaction A + A $\rightarrow$ products; rate = k\[A]$^2$ 

BE CAREFUL!! We can only equate the coefficient and reaction order for a single elementary step
