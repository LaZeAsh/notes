ngrok is an application that allows you to make your APIs public; Basically forward them from localhost to being able to be accessed from the internet

Documentation: https://ngrok.com/docs/
## Quickstart

After installing ngrok (how to do this can be found on documentation) just run the command

```bash
ngrok http [LINK]
```

This will run your application and give you a link where your API is accessible
