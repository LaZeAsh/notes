I graduated from Foothill High School in Pleasanton, CA on May 31st, 2024.

*insert picture of my graduation when I actually graduate*

My next 5 years will be spent at the [[University of Waterloo]] pursuing Software Engineering

## Looking Back

I had an interesting 4 years, people say time usually flies but for me when I entered high school seems like forever ago. I have met so many new people, learned so many new things, built many new interests, and am such a different human being than when I started high school it feels unreal.
