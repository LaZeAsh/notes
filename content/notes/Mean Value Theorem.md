title: "Mean Value Theorem"
---

Introduced to this in [[AP Calculus AB]]

Mean Value Theorem deals with slope; Average Rate of Change = Instantaneous Rate of Change

AROC = IROC

There exists a value x = c over the interval a $\leq$ x $\leq$ b such that the slope of the secant is equal to the slope of the tangent IF f is `continous` and `differentiable`
