title: "Interacting Circles"
---

This is an assignment for [[AP Calculus AB]] post-AP Test and I found this topic uniquely interesting

How 3 circles can interact
## Rules

- Don't allow 2 circles to touch, they have to overlap or be separate
- As circle count goes up you CANNOT have 3 going through the same point
- Cannot move a circle out to infinity so it becomes a straight line
- Mirror images count as 1
