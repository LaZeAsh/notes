title: "We Ball"
---

A phrase I say when I get rejected/don't get what I want. It's basically reassurance to myself that I will do better in the future.

## Origin

I am actually not sure why I started saying this phrase, I think I heard someone else say it and I eventually picked it up, or I started randomly saying it, or I saw this somewhere else.

## Purpose

No purpose really, I guess it's motivation that I will do better next time
