## Vector Equations of Lines

Need 2 things to make a vector equation of the line

1. A point P on the line
2. A nonzero vector $\vec{d}$ in the direction of the line (called a direction vector for the line)

> [!Definition 1.4.1]
> 
> A line in $\mathbb{R}^n$ through a point P with direction $\vec{d}$, where $\vec{d} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is non-zero is given by vector equation
> $\vec{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ ... \\ x_n \end{bmatrix} = \vec{OP} + t\vec{d}$, t $\in \mathbb{R}$
> 
> The vector $\vec{d}$ is called a **direction vector** for this line

> $\vec{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ ... \\ x_n \end{bmatrix} = \vec{OP} + s\vec{u} + t\vec{v}, s, t, \in \mathbb{R}$
>
> where $\vec{u}, \vec{v} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ are non-zero non parallel vectors
