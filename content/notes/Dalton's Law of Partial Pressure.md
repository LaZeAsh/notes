Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures states:

The sum of the individual pressures of all the gases that make up a mixture is equal to the total pressure exerted by the mixture.

Formula:
P$_{tot}$ = P$_1$ + P$_2$ + P$_3$ ...

(as long as same temp and volume)

## Clues when to use Dalton's Law

- The gas is collected by water displacement
- The gas is collected over water
- The question asks about "dry gas"
- The question gives you the vapor pressure of water

## Mole Fraction

To find partial pressure exerted by individual gas A use:

P$_A$ = $\frac{moles A}{total moles}$ * P$_{tot}$
