Introduced to this in [[AP Chemistry]]

K$_a$ = $\frac{[H^+][A^-]}{[HA]}$ = \[H$^+$]$\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}$

Negative log both sides

-log K$_a$ = -log\[H$^+$]-log$\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}$

## Final Equation

pH = pK$_a$ + log$\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}$

pK$_a$ = -logK$_a$

pK$_b$ = - logK$_b$

## Trends

\[HA] = \[A$^-$]

- log 1 = 0
- pH = pK$_a$
- makes the best buffer solution

\[HA] > \[A$^-$]

- log of a # < 1 = negative
- pH < pK$_a$
- more acid than base = lower pH

\[HA] < \[A$^-$]

- log of a # > 1 = positive
- pH > pK$_a$
- more conjugate base than acid = higher pH

## Buffering Capacity

pH = pK$_a$ + log$\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}$

- pH of a buffered solution is determined by the K$_a$ and the ratio $\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}$ 
- Capacity of a buffered solution is determined by the magnitude of both \[A$^-$] and \[HA]
	- greater concentration of \[A$^-$] and \[HA] = greater amount of strong acid/base can be added with minimal pH change
