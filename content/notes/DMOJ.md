title: "DMOJ"
---

I started DMOJ (seriously at least) in my senior year after I got into the [[University of Waterloo]]. I want to get better at competitive programming and beat someone in a contest so I am grinding.

Some of the problems I did earlier were in [[Python]] but most of the problems I do now are in [[C++]].
