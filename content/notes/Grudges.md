Grudge -  A feeling of ill will or resentment resulting from a past insult or injury (Google)

I think life's too short to hold grudges.

Throughout high school I found some people that I found quite a bit of people that I do not like being around and some people with who I have had arguments.

I don't hold grudges against these people...

The next time you see them would you rather remember a friend or someone you are on good terms with instead of someone you have to avoid because of something stupid you both are over?

To date I don't have a grudge against anyone

Now does this mean the person who you dislike or have arguments with has to be your best friend?

No, I would prefer to spend my time with someone else but that doesn't mean you guys cannot be acquaintances (someone you know personally but is not officially your friend)

At the end of the day we're all humans on the train to our graves if I really care that me and Alex had an argument over a couple text messages (literally nothing more than pixels on our phones) then I clearly don't have anything better to do with my time...
