- Low/er energy = More Stability in chemistry
- Energy levels exist they just don't have electrons occupying them
- E$_{photon}$ depends on the difference in the energy levels
- E = $\frac{hc}{\lambda (lambda)}$
- If electron is moving from 4th energy level to 2nd energy level 

ROYGBIV
700 nm -> 400 nm

Outside of violet region is ultra violet

Outside of red region infrared red
