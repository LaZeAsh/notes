- FRQ will have 1 box which will have all the variables where you fill in the value
- The equation in the 2nd box
- The 4 part calculation will be 3rd box
- HE WILL HELP US FIND THE 3RD VARIABLE IF YOU USE THIS METHOD
- Photogates WILL be on the final
- Units are going to matter on this test he WILL trick us, 9.8 $\frac{m}{s^2}$ or 32 $\frac{ft}{s^2}$
- If you want the conversion factor on the test you're going to have to ask for it, he won't give it to you
- 1 Horizontal problem (acceleration will be non zero)
- 1 vertical problem (rock drops off a bridge how long it takes how far it takes)
- Mark the same answer as the previous question, will give a horizontal problem length of a skid mark that'd 4.6 m long what's the acceleration of the car that had to stop because of a small child on the road
- Now this question is worth 2 points as same answer for 2 questions
- One question like # 4 on Free Fall
- If throwing a rock up 2.3 m/s up then 2.3 m/s down as well
- Picture a golfer with a 0 angle driver, horizontal. 4 point question
- Projectile problem, moving horizontal and vertical at the same time
- If you shoot an arrow giv
- Describe displacement, velocity, acceleration for something I threw in the air and caught
- Wont give 2 equations to solve simultaneously
- If he aims at the monkey he'll hit the monkey if the monkey falls when the dart is shot
