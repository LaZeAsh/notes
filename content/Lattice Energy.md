## What is it?

Lattice energy is the energy required to completely separate a mole of solid ionic compound into gaseous ions

We can use [[Coulomb's Law]] to explain lattice energy trends (energy NOT force)
## Equation

Lattice Energy = R $\frac{Q_1 Q_2}{r}$ 

This is similar to [[Coulomb's Law]]

## Trends

As charge magnitude increases the lattice energy of ionic compound increases

Ayush terms: The higher 2 atoms that form a compound are charged the higher the lattice energy

As internuclear distance between the oppositely charged ions increases, the lattice energy decreases

Ayush terms: Smaller atomic radius -> more lattice energy

Ionic compounds with higher lattice energies have higher melting points

Ayush terms: Self explanatory, re-read it if you don't get it
